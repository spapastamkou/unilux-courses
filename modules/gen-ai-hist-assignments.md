Machine learning: a branch of AI that deals with creating algorithms that learn (= evolve to get more efficient) when applied to (large) corpora of data. What these algorithms do: they predict, based on statistic probabilities sequences of words. This is based on word vectorisation/embedding: strings of text (words) converted into sets of numbers (vectors, embeddings).

An example: web search engines apply this once you enter a query (see screenshot of Google engine)

What is an algorithm: 

GPT for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer: an architecture of machine learning (basically, data and algorithms). It can read and treat all input data at once and gets better when trained with large corpora of data. Improved accuracy of outputs.  

Attention mechanism: a technique that allows the nural network to focus on specific parts of an input sequence. Done by assigning weights to different parts of input sequence. Most important parts = heighest weights 

AM different from sequence to sequence model: 1) passing more data to the decoder through he hidden state, that allow the decoder to have more context 2) add an extra step before producing the output  

Hidden state: input + past inputs (the memory of all inputs)  in a RNN (recurrent neural network)

GPT: an architecture of machine learning (basically, data and algorithms). It can read and treat all input data at once and gets better when trained with large corpora of data. Improved accuracy of outputs. Simply put: it can generate unique text (output data) when it receives a specific query/instruction/prompt.

Tutorial Programming Historian 

Input data: some 4 000 articles from the British Press regarding Brexit. They were gathered using the UK web archive to create a set of URLs. The URLs were used afterwards to extract from the live web the content. The content was then cleaned from HTML tags to keep only the plain text. All the text (articles) were then gathered in a single TXT file. 

"In a way, the output of GPT is various interpretations of a singular history being performed, and you are the critic meant to analyze and elucidate each performance. Are these performances completely accurate to their source material? No, but in their “inaccuracy” we can find new perspectives and expositions that differ from our own, which ultimately expands our understanding of the subject at hand." Brousseau
