## Assignment 1 

Try to access the following article: 

Joseph Rudman, “Teaching Computers and the Humanities Courses: A Survey,” _Computers and the Humanities_ 21 (4) (December 1, 1987): 235–43, [https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00517812](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00517812)  

What are your remarks once you reach the URL that is provided above? Please list what is necessary to do to access the full content of the article. 

If you are unable to use the article, the instructors of the class will provide [a copy](/assets/rudman-1987-teaching-computers-and-the-humanities-courses-a-survey.pdf) of it. Please read the article and pay attention to the following points: 

- What kind of data are described in the article?
- Does the article provide direct access to any data? Pay attention to past practices that may be described in the text. 
- If the article does not provide direct access to data, can you specify why? 
- If the article does not provide direct access to data, what is the solution that is likely to be applied? 
- Given what you heard in the class for the new forms of scientific publishing related to the open science movement and policies, can you comment the context the article points to? 

## Assignment 2

Pick one of the articles from the list below: [List of data articles](#list-of-data-articles).

Examine the structure of the article and pay attention to the following elements: 

- Number of authors
- Information on other contributors: are there other distinct roles mentioned (for example: translator or other)
- Do you have full access to the text and the data? 
- How is the article structured? 
- How is the critical apparatus (notes, bibliography) integrated in the text?
- How are primary sources/data integrated in the text? If they are accessible, please note where the dataset is hosted. Could you reuse them?
- Are there secondary data available? For example, visualizations, maps, lists, etc.
- Do you have information about the peer review process that guarantees the scientific quality of the article (reviewers names, access to reviews...)
- Is there a licence applied to the article?
- Explore the tabs around the article: 
	- what kind of information do they provide?
	- what possibilities do they provide?

## Assignment 3 

The references below provide access to the different layers of a scientific work (dataset, article on data methodology, article with traditional scientific narrative) published in three different venues: 

Crymble, Adam, Louise Falcini, and Tim Hitchcock. “Vagrant Lives: 14,789 Vagrants Processed by Middlesex County, 1777-1786” (version 1.2). _Zenodo_, 16 September 2015. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1217600 

Hitchcock, Tim, Adam Crymble, and Louise Falcini. “Vagrant lives: 14,789 vagrants processed by the county of Middlesex, 1777–1786.” _Journal of Open Humanities Data_ 1 (2015). DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/johd.1 

Hitchcock, Tim, Adam Crymble, and Louise Falcini. “Loose, idle and disorderly: vagrant removal in late eighteenth-century Middlesex.” _Social History_ 39 (4) (2014): 509-527. Copy made available by the authors on Figshare repository. https://sussex.figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Loose_idle_and_disorderly_vagrant_removal_in_late_eighteenth-century_Middlesex/23411330?file=41133491  

1. Take a look to each of these publications and provide a short description. Combine them and present very briefly the different facets of scientific work they represent. 

2. Pick an article of your choice from the [Journal of Digital History](https://journalofdigitalhistory.org/en). Compare its structure with the 3-facet work described above. Can you spot differences and common features?
