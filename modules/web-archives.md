## Assignment 4 - Collecting social media (YouTube) data

Your group will work with the following audiovisual resource available on YouTube: 

Deutsche Welle Documentary. "Luxembourg: Poverty in Europe's wealthiest country". YouTube Video. 28:25 minutes. 30 April 2024. https://youtu.be/d_XVU7VsG4Y 

This short documentary on poverty in Luxembourg and available on the online social network YouTube has gathered more than 2 000 comments. Imagine that you are interested in working on the transnational perceptions of the poverty in Luxembourg, and that comments posted on online social networks are sources to you. You have the possibility, and the tools (specialized software or a programming language), to collect these comments in form of structured data, and apply various methods of analysis, including quantitative. For this assignment you can use [Communalytic](https://communalytic.org/){target="_blank"}, an easy-to-use online service even for total beginners. At least one member of your group should open a (free) account of EDU type (for teaching and learning). For this, you need to have a Gmail user account. Once you have signed-in, go to [My Datasets](https://edu.communalytic.org/datasets/){target="_blank"} and click on the box YouTube/Comments. Let yourself be guided by the instructions that are displayed to start collecting the data. This involves naming your dataset and informing the URL of the video in the dialogue box. Launch the collect process. Once your dataset is ready, you get notified by email. Download your dataset as .csv file. Open it and inspect the data and metadata. 

Prepare a short oral presentation of 5 minutes and do not forget to consider the following questions: 

1. Describe briefly the operation: source (the video), interest in collective sensibilities expressed in the comments, data collection using dedicated software 
2. Name the software you used, explain what it does and what its main features are
3. Explore the dataset you obtained (the .csv file with the exported data): what do the data look like, which categories of data you obtained, how you imagine using them?  
4. Explore the Dataset Overview, and browse the other types of analysis that are embedded in Communalytic: (Toxicity, Sentiment, Topic, Network Analysis). You can pick one or two to have time to inspect the results in detail. Explain the most important findings in your own words and describe in what ways these results are visualized and what they tell us. 

### After completing this assignment... 
... you should be able to: 

1. Have led a hands-on experience with collecting online social networks data 
2. Understand the type of workflows, tools and analysis involved in these operations


## Assignment 5 - Fluidity of the web  

The web archives are archives in constant motion rather than fixed archived resources. Check the lesson on Wikipedia as a source of historical knowledge of the collection of Ranke.2. Pick the [assignment 4](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/wikipedia-historical-source/#assignment-04-behind-scenes.en){target="_blank"} dealing with the narratives and, by consequence, the web pages in constant motion. 

First read the introduction of assignment 4, and then focus on sub-assignment 4.b (skip 4.a). Experiment with the proposed exercice. 

Prepare an oral presentation of 5 minutes of the task you had to do, how your group worked, and what your group's main findings are.

### After completing this assignment... 
... you should be able to: 

1. Understand how collaborative technologies shape the moving nature of web content


## Assignment 6 - Publishing family and personal archives in the web 

Go to the lesson "The Web as a historical source; what historians need to know" of the colection of Ranke.2 and focus on the [assignment 5 on family and personal web archives](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/webarchives/#assignment-05-Micro-archiving-family){target="_blank"}. 

Read the part 5.a and focus on the case it presents. Skip the very last exercice that invites you to make a Google research to find more archives - we do not need to go furtehr today.

Based on your reading, what are the most important challenges this case study highlights ?  

Then read the part 5.b and answer the questions copied below: 
- What kind of content have you uploaded or posted on the web?
- Are you represented with your name, photo and profile on a social media platform? If so, which one(s)?
- Can you trace this back with the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/){target="_blank"}?
- Does a text, video, image or audio file created by you feature on a specific website or web page?
- Is part of your personal life and history also documented in analogue form through photo albums, handwritten letters, postcards or diaries?

If necessary, half of the group can work on 5.a and the other half on 5.b. 

Combine your findings to make a group presentation of 5 minutes. 

### After completing this assignment... 
... you should be able to: 

1. Identify some of the factors that may decide the digital life of a web resources 
2. Understand how your digital identity can be part of the history of the web


## Assignment 7 - Crowdsourced born digital archives

You will work with the [September 11 Digital Archive](https://911digitalarchive.org/){target="_blank"}. 

Inspect the About page of the website to gather context about the creation of the archive: when, why, by whom, what for, and how was it created?

Check the perimeter of the archived material: what types of resources were contributed? in what collections are they organized? 

Inspect the archived materials at the level of the item (an elementary object of the archive: a photo). Try to evaluate as a historian at least 4 or 5 archived resources (each member of the group could pick one or two), if possible from different collections of the archive. Check, for example, the collection "First Responders". Would you be able to reuse these items in a historical work? If not, why? 

Present your findings in a five-minute oral presentation. 

### After completing this assignment... 
... you should be able to: 

1. Understand in what conditions event-based born digital archives are created  
2. Identify the factors that help estimate the historical value of online archival materials
