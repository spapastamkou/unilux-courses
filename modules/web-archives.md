---

The assignments that follow below have vocation to offer a hands-on introduction to the web archives. They should ideally be done in groups of three, or four if necessary. 

## Assignment 1 - Stakes of archiving the web

Please read this article: 

Chris Stokel-Walker. ["We're losing our digital history. Can the Internet Archive save it?"](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240912-the-archivists-battling-to-save-the-internet). BBC website [htps://www.bbc.com](htps://www.bbc.com). 16 September 2024 

*Estimated reading time: 16 mins*

After reading the article, prepare a short oral presentation of 5 minutes. The presentation can focus on the aspects that the group finds most important. However, do not forget to consider the following questions:  

1. What is the main problem the article identifies? 

2. What is the Internet Archive (IA)? 

3. What are the solutions IA provides? 

4. What are the main impediments IA faces to accomplish the mission it undertook?  

### After completing this assignment... 
... you should be able to: 

 1. Understand the stakes of preservation of the websites and web objects 
 2. Identify the main actors of the preservation of the web, and know what Internet Archive accomplishes 


## Assignment 2 - Luxembourg Web Archive, an overview

Please take a look at [the page of the website of the BibliothÃ¨que nationale du Luxembourg offering general information on archiving the luxembourgish web](https://bnl.public.lu/en/offres-numeriques/webarchive.html) and then study thoroughly the presentation of the [Luxembourg Web Archive](https://www.webarchive.lu/).  

After reading the article, prepare a short oral presentation of 5 minutes. The presentation can focus on the aspects that the group finds most important. However, do not forget to consider the following questions:   

1. What is the mission of the BnL / Luxembourg Web Archive? 

2. What is the policy of collection (principles, perimeter of the archived resources...)  

3. How is organized the access to the archived resources? Are there any specific considerations or limitations to take into account? 

4. What is the network of the BnL in leading the mission of archiving the web at a national and international level? 


## Assignment 3 - Archiving luxembourg.lu

Explore the evolution of the official portal of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg via the history of its URL. Follow the instructions provided in [part 3.b "Exploring Luxembourg web content"](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/webarchives/#assignment-03-webarchive-national-dimension) of the lesson "The Web as a historical source; what historians need to know" of Ranke.2. You will work on selected parts of the proposed exercice as we suggest below: 

Go to the Wayback machine of the [Internet archive](https://archive.org/) and enter the following query: `www.luxembourg.lu`. You should arrive on the page https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.luxembourg.lu. 

Inspect the page of the results.

1. What kind of information do we obtain? 
2. What resources can we access? 
3. In the timeline that gives access to the archived pages, pick the very first and the very last. What are the differences and the similarities you notice once you reach the archived pages? 

Report your findings in a 5 mins presentation. You can collaborate with the group of the assignment 2 if necessary and, in any case, your group should present your findings after the group of assignment 2.  
    

## Assignment 4 - Collecting social media (YouTube) data

Your group will work with the following audiovisual resource available on YouTube: 

Deutsche Welle Documentary. "Luxembourg: Poverty in Europe's wealthiest country". YouTube Video. 28:25 minutes. 30 April 2024. https://youtu.be/d_XVU7VsG4Y 

This short documentary on poverty in Luxembourg and available on the online social network YouTube has gathered more than 2 000 comments. Imagine that you are interested in working on the transnational perceptions of the poverty in Luxembourg, and that comments posted on online social networks are sources to you. You have the possibility, and the tools (specialized software or a programming language), to collect these comments in form of structured data, and apply various methods of analysis, including quantitative. For this assignment you can use [Communalytic](https://communalytic.org/), an easy-to-use online service even for total beginners. At least one member of your group should open a (free) account of EDU type (for teaching and learning). For this, you need to have a Gmail user account. Once you have signed-in, go to [My Datasets](https://edu.communalytic.org/datasets/) and click on the box YouTube/Comments. Let yourself be guided by the instructions that are displayed to start collecting the data. This involves naming your dataset and informing the URL of the video in the dialogue box. Launch the collect process. Once your dataset is ready, you get notified by email. Download your dataset as .csv file. Open it and inspect the data and metadata. 

Prepare a short oral presentation of 5 minutes and do not forget to consider the following questions: 

1. Describe briefly the operation: source (the video), interest in collective sensibilities expressed in the comments, data collection using dedicated software 
2. Name the software you used, explain what it does and what its main features are
3. Explore the dataset you obtained (the .csv file with the exported data): what do the data look like, which categories of data you obtained, how you imagine using them?  
4. Explore the Dataset Overview, and browse the other types of analysis that are embedded in Communalytic: (Toxicity, Sentiment, Topic, Network Analysis). You can pick one or two to have time to inspect the results in detail. Explain the most important findings in your own words and describe in what ways these results are visualized and what they tell us. 

## Assignment 5  

The web archives are archives in constant motion rather than fixed archives resources. Check the part of a lesson on Wikipedia as a source of historical knowledge that focuses on the narratives and, by consequence, the web pages in constant motion. Focus on the introduction of assignment 4, then the sub-assignment 4.b (skip 4.a). Experiment with the proposed exercice and present what you had to do, how you worked, and what are your group's findings.

## Assignment 6 

Microarchiving: family and personal archives in the web 

Please read this part of a lesson on web archives that focuses on family and personal web archives: https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/webarchives/#assignment-05-Micro-archiving-family 
Read the part 5.a and focus on the case it presents but skip the very last part that proposes an exercice based on a Google research to find more archives.
Based on your reading, what are the most important challenges this case study highlights?  

Read the part 5.b and answer the first, thirs and fifth questions for the third you may need to use the Wayback machine of the Internet Archive). 

If necessary, half of the group can work on 5.a and the other half on 5.b. Combine your findings to make a group presentation of 5 mins. 

## Assignment 7 - Event-based, crowdsourced, born digital archive

You will work with the [September 11 Digital Archive](https://911digitalarchive.org/) 

Inspect the About page of the website to gather context about the creation of the archive: when, by whom, what for, and how was it created?

Check the perimeter of the archived material: what types of resources were contributed? in what collections are they organized? 

Inspect the archived materials at the level of the item (an elementary object of the archive). Try to evaluate as a historian at least 4 or 5 archived resources (each member of the group could pick one or two). Would you be able to reuse these items in a historical work? If not, why? 

Present your findings in a five minute oral presentation.     


> IMPORTANT! 
For this session, your Markdonw/GitHub assignment will be a short report on your group's work. You can write the group's report in a collaborative way (based on the presentation your group made) and deliver the same text for all the group members.
