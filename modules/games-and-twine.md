## Assignment - hands on with Twine

Use the online version of Twine available here: [https://twinery.org](https://twinery.org/). 

Choose `Use in your browser`.

Go to the website: [Minett Stories. Remixing Industrial Pasts in the Digital Age](https://minett-stories.lu/). The project focuses on the industrial history of Luxembourg through a micro-history of the Minett region. Among the historical materials and sources, you will find four graphic novels. You can use the scientific texts that accompany the graphic novels, written by historians, to build a scenario for a game with the help of a generative pretrained transformer. 

* Irene Portas Vázquez. When Italian communists inhabited the Minett. Minett Stories. https://minett-stories.lu/en/story/when-italian-communists-inhabited-the-minett 

* Jens van de Maele. Steel, smoke and dust. Minett Stories. https://minett-stories.lu/en/story/history-of-air-pollution 

* Jens van de Maele. Dr Musel looks at dusty skies. Minett Stories. https://minett-stories.lu/en/story/history-of-air-pollution-2 

* Julia Harnoncourt. Brothers in exile. Minett Stories. https://minett-stories.lu/en/story/brothers-in-exile  

Pick a generative pretrained transformer of your choice. It is better if you work connected to a personal account. 

You might need to copy paste the text of the web page using the dialog box of the gpt or provide (attach) a file with the copy pasted text.

Use the following prompt:  

- Read the attached text
- Draft a storyboard for a game of 30 minutes
- The storyboard must be built around 3 questions based on this text. Each question should offer 2 choices. Conceive these questions as paths to go further in the game. 


You will obtain a scenario for a game as output. If you are happy with it, use it to build a game on Twinery following the instructions you found in the Programming Historian lesson or the video tutorial. 

## Final class assignment

This assignment was conceived by Eliane Schmid. 


Create a game that has an educational value: 
-	Your audience/ the players should learn something about a historical event
-	Your audience/ the players should be challenged to think critically when they choose different paths in your game
-	Your audience/ the players should be able to recognize an argument/ a research question 

Your game should be based on:
-	at least 5 primary sources (newspaper articles, photos, primary literature, etc.)
-	at least 3 secondary sources (at least one about the theory of games, and 2 about the topic you are narrating in your game)

AI/ LLMs:
-	You are allowed to use an LLM of your choice to write the storyboard but you do not have to. 
-	Double check that the facts which you researched are not distorted when you use the LLM for narration purposes. 
-	Take a screenshot of the questions you asked the LLM to help build your storyboard.
-	Disclose what LLM you used and how you used it for the purpose of your game creation process. 

Citations:
-	As in any paper or assignment you are writing in history, properly cite your sources (any citation style is fine, as long as you are consistent)
-	For practical purposes, apply in-text citations in your games. 


Formal Aspects:
-	Your game should have between 10-15 branches
-	Each branch should contain information about your topic in full sentences (min. 100 words)
-	Please write full sentences for your links/ questions/ choices


Grading Criteria:
-	Formal aspects adhered to
-	Proper citations
-	Min. 5 primary sources and min. 3 secondary sources of good scientifically sound quality – sound research
-	Clear argument
-	Creativity
-	Educational value – Have you thought about your audience?
