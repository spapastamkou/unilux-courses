## Zotero in a nutshell 

Zotero was [created in 2006](https://rrchnm.org/portfolio-item/zotero/), by researchers for researchers, at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (George Mason University, Virginia, United States of America) and is currently developed by the nonprofit [Corporation for Digital Scholarship](https://digitalscholar.org/).

It is a free open source software that allows to manage research materials such as books, articles, web documents, recordings, etc. In Zotero, each one of these materials is considered an item, regardless of the documents type. 

The software can be used in standalone mode, which means you need to [install it](#install-zotero) on your personal computer. You can also use it via an internet browser, especially if you need to work in collaboration with other users. In any case, you will have to create a userccount and be careful to keep your libraries synchronized, if you alternate the two above ways of use. 

## Why use Zotero

Zotero allows to manage the items in the following ways:
