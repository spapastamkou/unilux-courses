## Zotero in a nutshell 

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) was [created in 2006](https://rrchnm.org/portfolio-item/zotero/), by researchers for researchers, at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (George Mason University, Virginia, United States of America) and is currently developed by the nonprofit [Corporation for Digital Scholarship](https://digitalscholar.org/).

It is a free open source software that allows to manage research materials such as books, articles, web documents, recordings, etc. In Zotero, each one of these materials is considered an item, regardless of the documents type. 

The software can be used in standalone mode, which means you need to [install it](#install-zotero) on your personal computer. You can also use it via an internet browser, especially if you need to work in collaboration with other users. In any case, you will have to create a userccount and be careful to keep your libraries synchronized, if you alternate the two above ways of use. 

## Why use Zotero

Zotero allows to manage the items in the following ways: 

* save the bibliographic references
* permanently access the references via the software's interface
* organize the items in meaningful ways by creating libraries (folders)
* index the items, using tags
* annotate by creating notes attached to each item
* integrate the references in a text while using a word processor
* create bibliographies

Zotero ensure the following:

* gain time (more soon!)
* have well organized, harmonized and structures bibliographies and citations 
* reproducible research

## Install Zotero

To install Zotero, go to the [download page](https://www.zotero.org/download/) and pick the version that fits your operating system. Make sure to download also the Zotero connector depending the internet browser you use. If necessary, consult the [installation instructions](https://www.zotero.org/support/installation).

Do not forget to [create a user account](https://www.zotero.org/user/register). 

## How to use Zotero

Now that you have hopefully installed Zotero succesfully, please launch it and let us explore some ways you can use the software. 

First, walk through the interface. In the center, a large zone displays a list of the title, creator, and type of the items stored in your Zotero. 

On the left, you can access and manage the list of libraries (folders) and their arborescence. On the tope left the main menu is available. Finally, on the right, you can access the zone of the menu at the level of the item.

### Create a collection

A collection must be thought as a coherent set of references corresponding to a given research; it can be thematically or chronologically organized and structures in sub-collections. The zone of the collections (on the lefit of the main interface of Zotero) offers two embedded collections: `My Library` in which a user can create as many collections as they wish (depending the storage capacity); and `Group Libraries` which are shared collections with other users. 

To create a colection in `My Library` there are various paths. 

1. From the main menu: Click on `File/New Collection`, then a box pops up to name and then create the collection. 
2. Add `New Collection` icon on the left top of the collection zone.
3. Right click on `My Library` then `New Collection`. 


### Insert bibliographic references

Before adding a new item, it is important to first pick the right collection by clicking on it. This is important to have well organized collections and avoid orphan references and unnecessary loss when you create your bibliographies. 

#### Add manually a reference

To add a new reference, there are various paths. 

1. From the main menu: Click on `File/New Item`, then select the type of document and click on it. This gives you access to a newly created notice in the menu of the right where you can enter information about the item. 
2. Add `New Item` icon on the left top of the main zone with the list of references.
3. `Add Item by Identifier`icon on the left top of the main zone with the list of references. You can enter a unique identiier such as an ISBN number or a DOI to semi-automatize the process of informing the menu of the item. 

#### Add a reference via your browser

Remember, you need to have installed the Zotero connector as [previously suggested](#install-zotero). Once done, your browser displays on top right an icon that lets you know Zotero has access and can save the type of resource it recognizes depending the page you are on: a web page, a newspaper article, a video recording... This is a quick way to save automatically the available descriptive information about an item: you only need to click on this icon and Zotero will do the rest. Please note that you need to have launched Zotero before and clicked on the right collection in which you wish to integrate the reference. 

### Add an attachment to an item

If you add a reference via the browser, Zotero imports automatically a PDF of a document, if it is available. 

It is possible to add an attachment manually: 
* from the main menu 
* from the Add an attachment icon
* by right-clicking on the reference and using the menu that appears

### Add tags
You can add a tag that caracterizes the item directly from the zone of the right menu (level of item). 
An item does not inherit the tags of the notes that can be attached to it, if the notes are tagged.
