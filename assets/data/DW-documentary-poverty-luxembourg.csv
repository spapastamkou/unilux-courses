- The first two homeless are basically saying that they migrated from Hungary to Luxembourg to get advantage of the social and healthcare system. As a reminder, the social and healthcare system can be sustained by taxes paid by Luxembourg residents (in first place) and by European citizen (in second place).

I studied and worked hard for many years to be able to find a job in Luxembourg and to move there legally. If it had not worked out, I would have just moved back to my country of origin instead of living on the street and demanding something for free... It is also a joke that 1 in 15 people are millionnaires, most of the people I know in Luxembourg are just simple working middle class. I know many people from Ukraine who moved because of the war, tried finding a job and then returned back to Ukraine when it did not work out, even despite the war. I do not understand why someone cannot just go back to Hungary or Portugal.

Not shocking, the countries people leave most are Romania, Poland, Greece, Portugal, Hungary. They mostly go to Spain, Italy, France, etc., But kinda shocking, a country that stood out that people move to, from more firmly established economies like Germany and and France--was Luxembourg. 

So this poverty/homeless story from only 2 months ago was not what I expected to find after having done my reading.

I can still remember when previsions of Luxembourg having 700k inhabitants by 2050 were considered unrealistically high and those propagating them in the late 90's (when Luxembourg had bare broken past the 400k number) were considered doomsayers.

Now it looks like we'll reach that number in 2025, a full generation earlier than those ""unrealistically high"" predictions of the late 90's. Or in other words, the population grew twice as fast as expected. Granted, that number got corrected upwards, first to 750k, then to 800k, but they stopped bothering after that making any clear predictions of the sort.

The result: Social housing is in extreme short supply since they never built near enough of them as they kept to their projections. It got increased the last couple years, but after decades of ""not near enough"", it's but a drop in the bucket now. Also, most of those are still houses, which even with more ""social"" prices, are still to expensive for the vast majority of people - even with 40-year mortgages!",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/@steveweidig5373,UCcrXvE6kKbeTtgjHIBsLNfQ,2024-06-16T13:18:58Z,,,,0

The Singaporean solution would not work in a large country but it would work for Luxembourg. Singapore is one of the wealthiest countries in the world like Luxembourg. It is a financial hub like Luxembourg. And it is a very small place (about 600 sq km) like Luxembourg. Its housing price has also skyrocketed. But you know what the difference is? 80% of Singaporean lives in government housing that is built by the government and is heavily regulated (in terms of who can buy, who can sell, who can own, who can live there, when an owner can sell, when a family can buy, how many units can one family owns, and even what happens to the house if the owner goes bankrupt, etc.). So for 80% of the Singaporeans, they are completely detached from the skyrocketed investment driven housing market. The ultra-rich can play their games and continue to profit from housing and the normal people can continue to live happily with a nice apartment. These do not conflict with one another. The Singaporean government has been running with this solution since the 1960s, pre-dating the founding of the Republic. It has worked for 60 years and this housing scheme arguably underpins Singapore's economic success in the first place, as people do not need to worry about getting a place to live in and therefore can invest their time and money in real businesses.",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/@raylee17,UCvZIE7qC_I2Hm0pQnP28sEQ,2024-05-28T07:48:58Z,,,,0

unrealistic what they said. Interestingly, there are 9.5 million people living in Hungary, but they could not make ends meet. Anyone who wants to work today will find a job, because we have a labour shortage. The unemployment rate is 3%. There are also a lot of vacancies. These two people, unfortunately, are homeless because they probably did not want to work. In Hungary, there are shelters for homeless people in the cities, where they can clean, get food and shelter, wash or change their clothes. They also receive medical care. Those who do not want to go to such shelters are visited by aid workers who bring them food, blankets, clothes and hot tea. Unfortunately, many people end up on the streets because of alcoholism or drug addiction. Those two people do not represent the real Hungarian situation, you should not believe everything they say. And to say that racism is rampant in Hungary and that Viktor Orbán is a bad man is simply not true. The problem is that in today's Western Europe, only those voices are allowed to be heard that criticise the current government. They are spreading a lot of lies about our little country because it is in someone's interest. I am very sorry that people are so impressionable and do not check any information.

Ironia e sapere: come Stephen Hawking è entrato nella cultura popolare

Non sarà il progresso tecnologico, né i robot a portare all'apocalisse economica, bensì l'avidità degli uomini. Non è nuovo a questo genere di esternazioni, ma sta volta Stephen Hawking lo dice a chiare lettere: ""Dovremmo aver paura del capitalismo, non delle macchine"". Durante un ""Ask Me Anything"" su Reddit, il celebre scienziato ha dichiarato che la disuguaglianza economica salirà alle stelle se, quando molti posti di lavoro saranno automatizzati, i ricchi proprietari di macchine continueranno a rifiutarsi di condividere la loro ricchezza in rapida proliferazione.

Se le macchine finiranno per produrre tutto quello di cui abbiamo bisogno, il risultato dipenderà da come le cose verranno distribuite. Tutti potranno godere di una vita serena nel tempo libero, se la ricchezza prodotta dalla macchina verrà condivisa, o la maggior parte delle persone si ritroveranno miseramente in povertà se la lobby dei proprietari delle macchine si batteranno contro la redistribuzione della ricchezza. Finora, la tendenza sembra essere verso la seconda opzione, con la tecnologia che sta creando crescente disuguaglianza.

In sostanza, i proprietari delle macchine diventeranno la borghesia di una nuova era, le cui aziende di loro proprietà non forniranno più posti di lavoro per i lavoratori in carne e ossa.",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/@elisabetta4478,UCs0uAg1YaqSdurVW7p2AKBA,2024-05-19T10:53:28Z,,,,0

It takes the authorities in Luxembourg 2 years (!!) to issue a construction permit.
The problem is, that if you buy a newly built property, the price _can_ increase between the signing of the contract and the commence of the construction. ( I have not seen this neither in Germany, nor in Holland).
And the price does increase: you have to pay 20-30K EUR more ( due to the delay of the permit).
Another fun fact is, that the purchase tax is 7.5%. ( Thus if you buy a house of 1.3 million, you pay almost 100 KEUR extra for the purchase tax).

That's how desperate people in other parts of the world are.

The whole world is imitating the U.S. since World War II and that's why we are also imitating their downfall.
The capitalists are telling us that things need to be the way are right now, but the trickling down concept simply doesn't work.

We don't need more freedom from our governments, it just benefits those who are already wealthy and privileged.
The poor people are left on their own, fighting over crumbs and blaming each other for a corrupt system.

If immigrants find jobs it means there are jobs, he is just either unskilled for them or doesn’t want to work because the pay is too low. Low pay is a real issue of course, but you have to start somewhere - maybe not put tiles like he said but work in a restaurant/cafe/anywhere else. If he thinks that being an immigrant is so easy, why doesn’t he try it in another country. Other European countries also have good benefits with locals complaining about immigration for the same reasons. 
Sure, the world is an unfair place that caters to those in power/people with money. You can try to fight injustice and help the poor like Alexandra does, and this is very honourable and I respect that a lot. But if you are just complaining and sitting on your ass, nobody is going to care, you just waste your time and don’t move forward. 
Being young nowadays is difficult, being young and poor is even more difficult. You are not going to get a job just because you think you are a “designer”. Getting a job as a designer requires more skills than just knowing how to “design”.

Nobody in leadership positions cares whether their subordinates have a square meal as long as their bank accounts are secure and overflowing. The human greed in today's world is mind boggling.

It does not suit their agenda. Its riches come from a more than obvious offshore financial system (paradis fiscal). I urge the reader to search for 'Lux Leaks'. On the same note, Luxembourg is also known for its money laundering and well oiled machine, very well backed by its governments. That is why they have so much money. Loads of it. Locals and residents are leaving the country because the supposed high salaries do not cover expenses, is particular real state. Luxembourgers are leaving their own country and choosing bordering countries because they just can't afford. Exception is the old families who inherited land and real state and are having a financial blast. Luxembourg does not have natural resources or other sources of national income so the base of their success is pretty much on that.

When great technologies & beautiful progress is made for the species by organizations & companies full of people from all over the world. Will they keep arguing about poor or rich? Or being with their “own people”? Gate keeping their hubris driven views that holds them to the cyclic poisoning of the consciousness? Hiding behind ideas like ethnicity, colorism, inequalities of wealth & ideologies?

These transgressions against the progress of the species will be irrelevant in 1000+ years when we are on interplanetary bases & starships with super intelligent AGI. 

People who battle about ethnicity or inequality often lack respect for the species & have narrow selfish foresight. I know they’ll be left behind when the future is being built. It won’t be a choice because the needs of the species & the expansion will take precedent. 

Human nature dictates fear of the unknown & animosity via hubris attached to irrelevant hallucinations of purity or grandeur. But It also dictates the escape of such transgressions by the building of ideas from cognition & how it takes many views to create something great.

It is not possible for a homogeneous group to outdo a diverse group. Even if you pretend that diversity can be had as long as everyone is from the same continent or geographical area. Maybe in tiny battles, but never in longevity. (I.e the war between futurists & traditionalist) 

It is simple calculus & game theory. I hope the gatekeepers of the species are left behind so that progress can accelerate.

You should immigrate legally, thus giving you authorization to work, and hopefully making that nice salary, like the surrounding German, and French people seem to be doing. 
People with no experience, should then get more stable experience to back your skills. 
There also seems to be a lot of people that had drug issues. I'd love to know if they are from LUX, or they came to this new country.

- Lux is a ""tax haven"" for wealthy people from all over the world. Many rich have their residence in Lux, but they actually do not live there. A friend of mine is self employed, his job is to look after empty houses for super rich who are registered in Lux but are actually never physically there. They just moved their assets there, and own a house there. You will be surprised how many houses are empty all the time. 

- Lux, being a tiny country, is a banking center. These upper 1% of the people earn a lot of money - but if you take these people out of the statistics, the average income before taxes in Lux is approx 65K euro/ year, and if you see the cost of living, it is hard to come by as a single unmarried with that amount of money.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/@allesklar221,UCIoQbCn7By4K9YWrFP271MQ,2024-05-01T08:36:10Z,UgyWBHA4EizRGO0Dusd4AaABAg,@shazanakhan9807,,2

Because incentives are there and all they do is just follow the incentive. It's human nature to preserve to survive, wealth included, rather than considering it's just their fault, greed, or sinful behaviour

Therefore, the best store of wealth shouldn't have any other good utility value, living in it, curing diseases, edible and so on, except being the best store of value. 

We can't fix the problem of homelessness nowadays until we figure it out how to lower incentive much enough to demotivate wealthier people from collecting real estate to preserve their wealth

It's the game of incentives afterall. Fixing problem by fixing the incentives and people will follow that incentives and adapt automatically without any authoritative power to persuade or impose anyone to do anything.

As for Luxembourg. I'd take a bet that this doesn't apply to cities and villages such as Vianden and Echternach and Diekirch and such. 
Only Luxembourg city where the money is at. So that's where immigrants will go to. This documentary is biased ass hell. 
Like i said. It goes for the entirety of Westen Europe. With every major city in it. Amsterdam for my point of view is a complete getto except where the money is at. The rest of the Netherlands is doing fine.

Rroma (more commonly known as gypsies, racial slur) originally come from India, and they mostly live in SE quarter of Europe, but do not constitute a majority in any country. Most EU countries noticed a lot of Rroma coming in from Bulgaria and Romania after these countries joined it. They are often referred to as Bulgarians and Romanians, to the dismay of the non-Rroma Bulgarians and Romanians.

The problem here is that Rroma are very disadvantaged, with a negative circle of discrimination, racism, unemployment, criminal tendencies, prostitution, unsocial behaviour etc.

Almost all slum dwellers in Europe are Rroma. The majority of prostitutes in Western Europe are Rroma. The beggars in the streets are almost all Rroma.

The rich employ accountants that know every trick in the book and find multiple ways of claiming tax back 
You buy a car to run your kids to school. That money comes out of your pocket, and stays out.
 A rich person buys a car at 10 times the price, writes it off as expenses, tell the tax man it's for business purposes - and gives it to his trophy wife as a runaround.
Having bought a van for the purpose of business, and with a neighbour who bought a van for her business, we both know - the tax man never checks to see how the vehicle is being used. They don't even come round and check if it is a van or not. They're not interested when you sell it, how much you sell it for, and don't ask for that sale money to be returned to the tax coffers. It's yours.
The rich write off new phones, phone bills, computers, offices, clothes, hotel bills, business lunches, private jets, charity donations (that's a great scam that one. Donate $4,000,000 to charity, make your donation public to win public adoration, write it off against taxes, so the public end up effectively paying for that, since less money goes to the government and poorer people end up with less), they even claim against homes in other locations where their businesses are situated. 
Accountancy assures that the richer you are the less percentage tax you end up paying. That's why there was such an uproar when the likes of Amazon, Google and eBay were finally forced to pay outstanding taxes to those countries bothered enough to keep pursuing them - and ended up paying paltry amounts of tax ( to ensure those countries never bother again). They 'know' how to work and how to hurt the system. 
And how did it get like this?
Because super rich companies and billionaires help certain individuals into politics, with promises of jobs as a board member after their political days. Politicians and board members are now stepping back and forth, interchanging between business and government, honing the rules and regulations surrounding taxation in the favour of businesses - and not ordinary people.

In the UK, you can earn up to around £14,000 (I think), before you pay any income tax.
In the US, you pay income tax - whatever you earn. The lowest tax rate band in the US is 10% on 'all' money earned 'up to a certain limit' and not down to a certain limit. There is no minimum entitlement, like in the UK. 

Maybe watch a few economics channels, made by actual economics experts with real life experience in government and big business. There are plenty of good ones on YouTube (George Gammon for example). I watched a lot during the pandemic, enough to make me feel well and truly sick at the situation.
But as well as learning about how the likes of Bezos and Musk work the system so they pay laughably little tax when ratioed against that paid by an ordinary middle class earner, these economics advisors also tell us folks how we can better safeguard ourselves from the fast approaching global breakdown. 
I used some of their advice and it has placed me in a better position, so it is not advice to be listened to briefly, and then dismissed with the next kitten and puppy video.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/@Debbie-henri,UCzUuDxIuyW7sKAlBfNWNETw,2024-05-05T06:33:26Z,Ugyxo6OrdK3PwXb1bOZ4AaABAg,@santamariamarvy,,0

There was a time when I could get a job easily with my previous experience. 
I married and took time off to raise my son, who had speech problems, homeschooling him until he was 18 and at a stage where he was capable of making himself understood. I continued helping him through further education until he could take care of that himself.
 When it came to time to look for a job, I couldn't find one. No one gives me an interview. No one answers applications.
I'm 57. No one wants a skilled gardener, not at my age. I'm too old. They want youngsters.
I've tried retraining, but it's too hard at my age. I just can't retain it all, the laws and regulations numbers they put in everything these days. I can't get on with all this computer stuff beyond emails and dropping comments on YouTube, and computers have infiltrated everything these days. 
Things were so much easier in the past. 

If I hadn't had to look after and teach my son, likely I would have remained working and been all right. But now I haven't worked long enough to qualify for a state pension.

It's funny that I'm the immigrant here and I'm the one telling the germans that the amount of people from abroad that they are allowing is lunatic and unsustainable.
They are so blind, people don't connect the dots, they don't realize how immigration affects the housing problem and the cost of living. They just care about being politically correct, while creating a snow ball effect.

You make a study of your life, and you will be surprised just how often you are putting money into the pockets of just a handful of super rich. 
And they now try tricks to 'shame' you into buying their products, pretending they're environmentally friendly or healthy, when they are far from it. 
Sadly, where the planet is concerned, climate change is the new, exploitable business venture. The super rich are going to make sure they are going to benefit from any social and environmental conditions, they hire teams of people to work on exploitative ideas all the time.

You got a point, there is tendency among Europeans in general to convey meaning in diplomatic ways. But we as foreigners shouldn’t Americanise things.
The Concept of race and skin tune in America has roots in injustice and slavery within America and the Hollywood was created to stigmatise against us. But the concept of race and skin tune is geographical in EU which carry less weight when it comes to racism in EU.
As our part we have to blend with them as well. For example An English person going to Asia he would not demand for English food instead he would blend and eat Asian food.

Communism you say? 

Well consider your own anatomy first. 

Superdeterministic Consciousness:

The unconscious mind ""sells"" the conscious mind on the concept of Reality. The conscious mind ""buys"" Reality from the unconscious mind.

Forming an illusory feedback system (creating the illusion of choice).

The subconscious mind being a broker between both; neurological imbalances occurring when the conscious mind resists unconscious narratives (superdeterministic).

Sentience (environmental feedback) propagates consciousness through emergent (microorganisms forming macroscopic life) sensory experiences (environmental exposure), leading to the formation of memories, thus establishing corollary emotional states (dependent on experiences experienced). These emotional markers are activated during recall (remembering).

(Intelligence levels also being predetermined)

Microorganisms are sentient but don't experience conscious intelligence until emergence is factored; swarming as a collective through emergence - forming greater scales of intelligence (hive-mind/macroscopic life).

Everything naturally occurring is Nature, which includes plants, microorganisms, humans (all lifeforms), atoms, energy, stars, planets, black holes, cancer, AIDS, space, Dreams, and Consciousness. (Say what!?)

Nature is Emergence. 

Roughly half of the total cells (~15 trillion!) comprising an average human are other individually sentient organisms (microbiota). 

Any individual that believes they aren't being wholly influenced by half of their overall cellular matrix; I would encourage them to test that theory, by subtracting half of themselves from existence.
