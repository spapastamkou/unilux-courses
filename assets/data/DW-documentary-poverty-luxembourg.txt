A social house in Luxembourg costs around 700k eur...for which you are not a full owner as the land will remain to the state. And when you want to sell the house you will be force to sell it back to the state with more or less the same price. That is why there are many of these so called social houses which are not selling...cause the ones that can afford them, realize it is a bad business so they prefer to invest their money in something else and live across the border or rent (is some cases it is better to rent than pay mortgage to a social house).
I live in Hawaii. Most expensive state in my country. I’m native Hawaiian and there are not many places for folks.
If you live in the richest country in the world, you have no disabilities or not even insane and you are poor?. Ohh really you can't blame anyone but yourself
Those luxembourgers saying that the government doesn't care about luxembourgers are talking rubbish. The best paid jobs in Luxembourg are the state jobs which are only accessible to locals. And accusing immigrants that they are stealing jobs for the locals it is the classic way of victimizing yourself because you are either lazy, incompetent or not educated.
It seems that those 2 hungarians homeless are pretty happy with their choices. Why saved them if they like their status ?
BECOMING SLAVES OF DESIRES AND PLEASURES IS A LIMITED WAY OF PERCEIVING LIFE.
4:27 I suppose alexandra has a job dealing with this issue of homelessness, yet, apparently, she can't relate to a business owner's dilemma of having homeless camping out at their doorstep. We need to have her running a coffee shop with homeless settling at her doorstep, that way she could tell her customers to be nice to the people who live at the doorstep of her business.
They are homeless but they find money for drugs
His son is already doing well in Business with those superhero figures he can sell for Thousand of Euros in a few years. I saw about 12 of them which can easily make him about $500,000,00
Shameless to the rich. Shameless to the government
It’s true those out of Lux get more than the locals. It’s the same all over the world.   People come to lux to steal and there are professional beggars.    Shocking that the world has become so distant from its own people.
Why are 2 Hungarian men there ??? 🤡🤣 They live that way because they want to live that way....
They say that their government doesn't think about them but why

Cool
They will go to whomever gives them the most free stuff.
Fantastic, in Luxembourg even homeless are informed that Mr Orban is horrible. DW next time try to find some more competent speaker for comments on politics.

See how the faithful city     has become a prostitute!

They do not defend the cause of the fatherless;     the widow’s case does not come before them.

Must go back to Romania 🇷🇴 immediately than living on street
I have watched alot of programs about homelessness in western Europe and the USA, and I have found out that there is no problem of housing or jobs, but the problem is drug addiction, that is core root of homelessness.
Europe 🌍
Poverty in Europe?! No ways!
Monaco 🇲🇨 is the richest country in Europe. Not Luxembourg 🇱🇺.
Yet mass immigration continues unabated.
It's not people in Luxembourg who are poor... it's the people who come into the country....
what an oxymoron.. if you have that level of poverty then you are not rich.. stop thinking you are wealthy..

It's everywhere,, there is no country left ,, homeless everywhere, but it's because of both sides .. people's bad habits bad government.
If its so bad why did u leave home. Its better than your own country. Did u contribute to the society?
Poverty is more a case of mindset than failure of responsibility of state.
In  russia no one is homeless because their socialist government give them free apartments free education and free health ,perfect  socialist nation
Poor europe i prefer them to join russia for better living, at least russia will provide you with home and food , join russia
People in the rural areas in Russia are poor.
Hahaha russia is becoming rich in reality and this fucking European become poor great to watch
Hahah
If you're a migrant and living like this, you shouldn't be there, it's that simple.
Luxumbourg don't have much of natural resources. But it have plenty of maffia , drug dealers and sex human traffickers. Luxumbourg is a Tax Haven and paradise of the power elites.😅
@@alberthenriette8976 alb it's called Mafia actually ....
I feel so sad to see people in such misery in a rich country like Europe. Shame on you politicians. You just talk but you do nothing to bring fairness and justice to citizens. YOU JUST TALK....blah blah blah.
You see those so-called PhD politicians ignoring things like this before it happens be careful Berlin Germany.. by increasing rent so often this is what going to happen.. I thought people was so educated would know this 😅😅😅😅
Saying that the average annual income in Luxembourg is 116k and almost 20% poverty is wrong. I live and work in Lux and the places that pay good money is banks and government, but even there lots do not have that income. Middle class is far below 116k, salary comes closer to 60-70k. If the purpose is to dramatise the situation you should have left out the part where the one homeless man says he's getting social security for free. It is clear that being homeless in Luxembourg is better than in any other country. Not saying that they have a good live in Lux. I feel sorry for everyone in that situation. But don't put out wrong facts to fit your purpose. Other than that I loved the documentary.

Ancient israeli law entitles evey cotizen right to get piece of farm land for free, which in turn gives them farming work. Why can't modern society adopt similar laws.
Eu doesn’t work in this regard
This is shocking! Luxembourg is one of the wealthiest nations per capita on earth.
when the west sends millions to wars & conflicts , there will be a stagflation , a combination of stagnation ( of industrial output and a lot of bankrupcy ) and inflation ( countless prize increases  for water , food , energy , housing etc. ) . Thank you Brussels , Luxembourg city and Strassbourg .
I used to be a contractor for cargolux..freetax 25euros/h with free accommodation...it was a bargain ..now .it still the same rate but not enough anymore..to cope with inflation.. even getting a full gasoline tank is not worth it. ...Crazy..days !!!
What kind of social institutions is it in democratic Eu ? Horrible to watch people sleeping on pipi cald floore , stealing at passangers for to get own mobile phone, begging for some money to kaffe and sigaretts. Its of course notorial criminnels and narkomans, but they shouldnt suffer for addiction or continew crime because of leak of humanlife foundation : ruff over head, warm place to be,  shower, wc, television. Many buildings are empty and its alot of money in the world to help to get better situation. I was robbed 3 times at Brussels railwaystation , used long time to recover over looses only because of system misunderstanding how to be realy engage. Non of crime were investigated!
"I live in a small room for 720 eur and eat microwave meals & cans." Dude I am living the same and partying like I am in heaven 😂  When you're expectation is not to be beaten by a police officer and die from hunger. The place is indeed heaven.

Thank God for the Russians, eh? Socialism — their people and countries’ largest exportation to Western society. America could learn a thing or two from siding with the Federation. How’s Kennedy doing?
In any society inflation is a disease which makes the GDP look fat. This fat is not real growth but makes things more expensive. Elderly income gets shrank and store owner value of good rises. The state shamelessly crow the GDP has grown. Yet nothing had been added physically.  Inflation is failure of state. People at the margin become poor  , old, retired and unemployed are victim of inflation.
You see how is already racism,  despite the law put in place.
Gentrification, inflation, homelessness and too few people who are able to help: it is everywhere!
This is just the beginning

Feel bit sad, I live in france.... heavy tax here and work more pay more...not much Real service
I wish I were wealthy enough to move to Luxembourg 🇱🇺 or to Switzerland 🇨🇭, but I cannot afford it!
There people don't want to work, they have other issues and blame the government. Beside the homeless from Europe will not get free life in Luxemburg.
Many of the immigrants had a medium quality life or better where they came from, the most poor cant afford to travel this far. So then the question is, is it ok to take the quality of life away from your own population? and give it away to someone that had a quite allright life where they came from?
Wonder if they are any Romanians living like that in Luxembourg
This is URSULA VAN DER DICTATOR fault
The US definitely doesn't give a damn! Homelessness has become criminalized again thanks to our corrupt Supreme Court! Unless you have lived that nightmare as I have, STFU! Americans are not as generous as the myth that seems to be perpetuated around the world.
in communism we all had houses, a job and free access to education and health, after communism fell, homeless people began to appear here too
May the gods bless Alexandra
Luxemburg tallmudder sinhog banksters & financiers do not even contribute to NATO.
Are these poor people immigrants or local? Or is it both?
It's pretty disingenuous of the filmmaker to downplay the effects immigrants have on poverty. A country will always have finite resources, and if they have to support an increasing number of immigrants, then it stands to reason that some of resources that could have been allocated to locals will go to immigrants. Appreciate the documentary, but I would appreciate it more if it paints a fairer picture with all aspects considered.
oh f** off Luxembourg, how is your average wage then 110,000 with such low population? do you think all of these people are earning this inside Luxembourg? hell no, this is German, French, Belgian and overseas company money not Luxembourg, irony that people are complain about foreigners when their whole industry is built on it.
L
just leave us alone all these immigrants gipsyes and everything ruined the streets i grew up in.
You will be homeless soon. Don't look for a house for them. Start to live like they do, it will be easier in few years to survive the winter outside. Europe is a creepy joke.
Patrick has a Late-Girlfriend not an ex-girlfriend.  They didn't break up, She died.  So sick of journalists saying Ex about people who died.
Here a 75m2 is eur 500k...just imagine
Tell me how every western country has a homeless problem even Australia
Few comments: - The first two homeless are basically saying that they migrated from Hungary to Luxembourg to get advantage of the social and healthcare system. As a reminder, the social and healthcare system can be sustained by taxes paid by Luxembourg residents (in first place) and by European citizen (in second place). So, these homeless guys should be prompted to re-enter in the working network of the society, anywhere (in Luxembourg or anywhere else), and not to rely on a system powered by other people. - Alexandra is a charitable woman who drives a sporty Mini Cooper (surely not an affordable car, for its segment). Nice contrast.
So true, If you all can't fix the problem  Who can😢 I enjoyed this very much.  A great eye opener from different view points.  Thank you
Next we should do poverty in Asia's most wealthiest nation.. Singapore. It's almost the same story
"hot meal for 50 cents...everyday" scumbags ! you get a life for free there and you still complain ?  9 millions are dying by  hunger and hunger-related diseases every year... worms !
we aspire at such poverty... try Romania ;)
I am a 4th grade med student from Lithuania and during summer I work as nurse assistant making 800€ and less per month. During studying year I work only 0.25 of full month since I study a lot to keep up excellent grades and not to pay for studies. So during study time I make 200 or less. This is insane. Prices of simple products reached sky high prices. Buying everything on discount, limiting going out with friends or just having hobbies. Don't say to work harder. We work hard as fuk and it's still not enough to have a good quality life. Even being a doctor is not worth in Lithuania. Not even taking about young people getting their own apartment. It sucks. And everything is gonna  become worse and worse. It's better to become like Jesus, being alive only on bread and Holy Spirit 🙂 Because that's what we are gonna only be able to purchase in the future.
The global housing "crisis" was caused by the banks in the western world..  Seems that everyone likes to ignore that elephant in the room, especially here in the US. All banks should be nationalized globally.
What I want is to change the image of Africa, because this is the richest continent ever. Trust me come what may this will be the beginning of a new continent. #Africawealthunlocked
580 euro for big apartment? xD In Netherland people make 2500 euro and apartment cost 2000 euro xD
The poor in Luxenbourg are not native Luxenborgers, they are foreign nationals who migrate for the social benefits. This situation is not sustainable in the long term.  😥 UK, Sweden, Denmark, Norway are all in the same situation.  🙄😧
the dubbing is extremely annoying, why?!!? Subtitles ffs. Huge Dislike and unrecommend!
tiny country tiny population .
Dear people struggling, churches can help as well. God bless you, praying for better help in Luxembourg.
I don’t understand why healthy young people are in this situation. In the supermarkets and in the fast food industry there is always available jobs.
They are poor wherever they go
The 22 y/o and the old man are  racist. Blaming it al on the foreigners....YKES
Proof that " there will be poor always, pathetically struggling" and the more government support there is for these people the more poor there will be. It's just human nature.
Let them go and look for job
😮😮😮😮😂🎉
Unfortunately you cannot have an overall hugely successful country and society without any problems. Overwhelmingly, Luxembourg works extremely well for both locals and foreigners. However there is a very small proportion of locals with mental health issues, drug addiction, etc which drives them towards homelessness, but overwhelmingly the poverty comes from thousands of foreigners, some from europe some some from far away countries that came just to milk the generous social security system, Luxembourg is a heaven to them compared to their home countries. And contrary to what that analyst says, there are many reasons why housing lags behind demand, and the 3000 families owning 50%+ of the constructible land is not a problem, but an extremely valuable element of stability in Luxembourg.
I will be soon homeless... Cant afford rent, food and clothes. Im sinking...
Great ❤❤❤❤
very good documentary. would be nice to see one that's about the poverty among people working full time jobs.
Being poor is a choice.
The GDP per capita figure is completely misleading. Many people from outside Luxembourg come each day to work there and go home again each night. Their wages count towards the GDP but, because they do not live there, when you divide GDP by the population you get a far higher number than you would expect. I am glad the government here outlawed begging. That is never a good solution and it is very annoying.
Europe without African resources is nothing if Africa can cut off everything western will suffer lots
There is a housing crisis in almost every first world country
SEEN WHOLE VIDEO. THANX.
Der Deutsche Karl Marx warnte uns vor dem, was mit dem Maximalprofitkapitalismus passieren würde. Wir wollten es nicht hören
Most supermarket foods around the world get thrown out and no one gets it. It's good to see it's used here.
This is a serious world problem now. It's time people stopped having five or six babies. We are wiping ourselves out. In another fifty years most of the world will be on the streets. This cannot continue. Only the Chinese have figured it out.
It's getting this way everywhere. In the UK London especially people are sleeping on the streets that have been born there while people are still being imported every day and are getting homes to live in. There aren't enough places to live anymore. Too many babies are being born and too many rich are keeping the money.
For that "Richest country in the world" title, somebody else is paying the price, don't be fooled. People in third world countries are living better than those in the west.
Why would people come to Luxembourg and consider that the state owes them something? Free housing, free food, free medicine and other benefits while they contribute nothing. If you do not like the conditions, you can always move to another place. I come from a much poorer country than Hungary or Portugal, where noone would get such benefits even without being homeless. I studied and worked hard for many years to be able to find a job in Luxembourg and to move there legally. If it had not worked out, I would have just moved back to my country of origin instead of living on the street and demanding something for free... It is also a joke that 1 in 15 people are millionnaires, most of the people I know in Luxembourg are just simple working middle class. I know many people from Ukraine who moved because of the war, tried finding a job and then returned back to Ukraine when it did not work out, even despite the war. I do not understand why someone cannot just go back to Hungary or Portugal. Unfortunately, there are plenty of poor people across the EU and even more outside of the EU, but a tiny country like Luxembourg cannot host them all and provide everyone with free housing and free food. Yes, there is competition on the job market, that is how capitalism works.
Immigration is the problem like always
In lstanbul they found a homeless beggar who is from Luxembourg he was on news people thought it was a joke 😅
I wish NATO never kills Gaddafi, never dropped bombs in Africa and middle East. Causing war everywhere on earth and expecting peace.
Sadly, the majority of Luxembourgers don’t care due to lack of moral courage and the ingrained belief that they are the richest country when it’s not true. Most Luxembourgers are struggling to survive because of the disproportional expenses from food to rent and low salaries with high taxes, while the civil servants get no scrutiny for their insane salaries.
Hungarian? Please, why are they there? So they can be homeless Luxembourg
At 3.40 the homeless man is crowing about how he loves it because it’s all free stuff and it’s heaven for them.  He goes onto say how Hungary is bad , maybe it’s because they do not tolerate sponging parasites like him
lmao so these hungarians travelled roughly 800 miles to be homeless in luxembourg, bummed around for seven years without getting it together, and this is somehow luxembourg's fault  edit: I spoke to soon, these *drug addicted* bums have to do this because victor orban is racist against other white people, which is why these people need to stay in luxembourg to get free health care (but they're victims)
Allah tauba
Thanks Alexandra. May the god help you.
1 in 15 people is a millionaire and still people live on roads 😂👍
I was shocked to see IV drug users injecting each other out in the public in Luxembourg, in full view of children and tourists like me walking on the sidewalk.
Aha, where is they documentary against Orban 😂.
yes😂 here is better to raise u like a pig for free
Same horror in US Citizens are mistreated in favor of illegal immigrants.
They’re speaking German??? Is that the language in Luxembourg? Why don’t they go back to their own countries ??? Confusing
Ill effects of capitalism......The American Dream.....Its much better in Russia.....
The effect of oligarchy…sending the Russian youth to die for some rich asholes😂
Why dont they go home?
Come to Sulawesi❤❤❤
Am really willing to help out there with My skills
The only way a normal or even higher paid tech person can afford property is inheritance . Germany only benefits families who were in Germany in the 1940s and never left.
You make it illegal to treat houses as an investment, or business (Airbnb). No more than two house properties per person. There problem solved. This happens all across EU and USA, it's slowly spreading all around the world. We can't let a handful of people literally owning the world.
Why not to move to Ukraine and write articles (for example)?
Ukraine needs your construction skills
You work for 40 years to have $1m in your retirement. Meanwhile some people are putting $10k in a meme coin for a few weeks and now they’re multi millionaires. I pray anyone who reads this will be successful in life.
This life is a sum of choices those individuals made in their life. Very educational nevertheless.
i really like how they try to not just rely on donations but also try to finance themselves through various enterprises. quite commendable.
They look like they belong to upper middle-income earner here in the Philippines and they consider themselves living in poverty.  I feel they're so lucky they're not living here in my shhty country.
Maybe if they get help and leave the alcohol and drugs, and try to work his life will be better
If they get hired, but if it was that easy, they would already have jobs.
Construction jobs in winter? DW makes outrageous claims and it's news reports demonstrate little research of the p[roblem they are reporting on.
These 2 Hungarians have homes inherited from socialist times in Hungary also they can go back Hungary get jobs & live in their homes! Enough Scammers & welfare Milkers!
Eat the f*cking rich!
Who's the rich?
The problem is we gave all the power to the wrong people.
Look wake up Nazis are emerging back again, this was there whole plan in the beginning.
Look, it's a really simple matter: for someone to get out of poverty and begin to lead a normal life, they need a place to live and enough money to eat, drink, get clothes and pay the bills. If you ask me, the state should ensure that this minimum is met by the minimum wage - anyone who works should be able to pay for the bare minimum AND pension contributions.
Luxembourger's need to get education.  Migrants come and make more money + get jobs especially Indians bottom line knowledge
I’m shocked that the young person feels so untitled he should have studied  something how can someone 22 years old wait for assistance can or is education not free there
Saying that there's a lack of jobs is blatantly wrong. There are so many jobs that you can find one in just 1-2 weeks.
the dark side in the picture, but it give me the believe about the kind people always exist to help you overcome the dark. Don't never give hope.
Do people speak german in hungary?
I once was a volunteer. I was told some stuff and haven't volunteered in years.
It's called progress. People should stay in their own countries when possible. If not migrate legally.
Tou only say this because your life is stable lol
Alexandra is a beautiful, kind and compassionate woman. Someone like this is a rare find. I would like to meet someone like this someday soon. I will  come to this city and seek her out.
Did not bother to watch tge complete video.  The first two hungarian who lives in a tend explained it well already:  Dude lost his teeth from years of drug abuse. They have free healthcare and the public Transport is free too. If they are not earning then it's their own fault. They already get the benefits from the taxes others pay.
As a Hungarian I can say things are moderately terrible here (Orban - agreed, no social security etc.) but come on... one guy says there's good money over there, things are great, the other one is flashing a set of dentures they got for free. They are literally living in filthy tents on the periphery of society for almost a decade, haven't even learnt to speak German or French, how did they live here if that's an upgrade😢 What's the big change? Social workers visiting the tent, free dentures provided, not having to listen that much to Orban? Wakey-wakey, that's still looks like a terrible living arrangement...
Tattoos, piercing....l don't have an experience but as long as they pay me...OK, wtf...
Don't worry, soon you all will be owning nothing and be happy. The Schwab declared so.
People who don't contribute to society expecting to receive everything for free will the doom of humanity.
Abolish ur stupid dukedom akl those idiotic institution leads to suffering
All white. All indigenous to their lands. And all homeless. The Zionist West cannot collapse soon enough.
Something is clearly wrong and no one's taking initiative to make things better.  Same thing is happening here in Canada.  Unfortunate.  The vulnerable suffer, and people don't care.  As long as the 2% are happy, and turn a blind eye, who cares about the rest of us.
Where you find the extreme rich.. you will find the extremely poor close by.
The problem is not luxemburg the people in the documetary are usless for modern economy.
Why is Europe obsessed with importing the third world’s problems?
and if these guys with 2 legs and 2 hands just work ???
les hongrois n'ont rien a faire au  Luxembourg....
Not one inch better than Germany!
Luxemburg is richer than Germany and they give more money per child to non natives and everything is the same in Germany. Too too many benefits receivers who coul work!
No, it's not growing. But Roma from Eastern Europe CHOOSE to come to beg and do other, more sinister things. Totally misleading angle. Fake news.
Alexandra is amazing
Poverty is a choice.
Not always. Some rich people become poor, because someone in the family made a bad choice, or someone disinherited them.
It’s Called capitalism, stop pretending. You hate socialism and communism. Face it…
And for good reason. The migrants in the video have fled the fallout of socialism and communism of their home countries.
Compared to America, any country is in poverty. I heard Europe doesn’t even have flushing toilets in most places, I’m so glad I have never left the US 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Not true, most of Europe has flushing toilets, maybe poor areas don't.
DW is such a shameless propaganda rag, they don't even disguise it any more. The Hungarian guys were saying how great Luxembourg is and yet this rag mascarading as a news agancy tries to spin the narrative to make it sound as if Luxembourg was hell... Completely shameless.
I live in the border with  Luxembourg, I remember we talked about this topic. Very well put together doc. Thanks for the awareness
Ma'am if i know how to speak German can i apply there in Luxembourg as a Nurse? From the Philippines
Luxembourg isn't Europe's wealthiest country, except on paper. GDP per capita means very little when 40% of the GDP consists of taxes on financial transactions. The government spends the money wisely, resulting in a good infrastructure, very clean streets, excellent healthcare etc., but that's money that doesn't end up in the pockets of its citizens. The average salary is very high because 10% of Luxembourg's citizens are extremely rich, but the median salary is just 40% higher than in Belgium, whereas the cost of living is more than 40% higher. Luxembourg looks clean on the outside, but with a child poverty rate of 24% and so many homeless people Luxembourg has little to be proud of.
affordable housing is joke here in Lux.
Muslim oil rich country are very wealthy and they have more poverty than Europea
wow sounds like new york
Is Monaco not in Europe?
Monaco is in Europe, close to France.
The world is becoming too greed due the Capitalism system and the multinational companies they have destroyed the normal way of living where people use to have their house in small towns, people where able to grow their own food, being sustainable in different aspects before they decided to privatize everything. People became more greed and the worse human traits are often seeing without any effort: dishonesty, lack of compassion etc. Everybody's living in the survive mode because they took everything. I'm from Africa Angola... Even in small town of my country things are becoming worse that's why I've decided to relocate myself in the village, I believe that I'll be healthier and happier far away from the stress and competition of the global market.
<I'm from Africa Angola...>  Home to failed communism.
The west and USA governments do not care about the lives of the poor. Politians in these countries are corrupt and greedy.
So he rather be homeless than live in a "racist" country? Pathetic. Zero sympathy.
Thank God at least the state is helping but a man needs to feel productive and take care of his family. These are hard times indeed
this a really poor view of what luxembourg is, I fully agree that we have to support the poor people, but i HATE the fact that this unemployed people blame immigration. Immigration is a TOTAL need for Luxembourg economy, high skill people, if these poor people want to follow a formation course to upgrade their poor level of education, let's make them educate
This young man needs to go back to school and get an EDUCATION, and stop blaming others for his lack of employment.
Stop immigrants
The grass is always greener on the other side.
these documentaries that never explain how  poverty is a consequence of unchecked, unregulated greed at the root of neoliberalism, are just desperation porn.
I’ve been watching many of the types of videos.  It appears to me,that the same problems are common and allow to happen in the majority of the world.  This is a planned out scenario.  Thanks Elites for your horrible policies 😡🇺🇸
Poverty in wealthy countries needs to be dealt with an integral approach. Mental health, economic education, education for the job, job opportunities, nhealth access and evaluation, drugs/alcohol rehabilitation, and opportunities for basic housing.
Lot more respectable than our homeless. All fucked up on Fenty where they can't even have normal human conversations anymore.
In the US donating or doing what these people are doing would be considered socialism, woke or going against the will of their deity.
This is happening all over the world.   In the US they're starting to criminalize homelessness, poverty and begging in some states in cities and any place or organization, including the religious that tries to help the poor are penalized.    It's not just the governments, it's societies and all pillars of society.
It's complicated. While I wholy support Alexandra and all social institutions, whether governmental or NGO's, there is more to it. Yes, Luxembourg is rich, and there should not be any persons on the street. Concerning residents, there is a lot that is done for them, and any reident of Luxembourg has the right to a minimum liveable income- go to your local "office social" and they will really (!) help you. But just imagine this scenario: a country of just about 600'000 people would offer the same help to any homeless guy coming from anywhere like they do for the Luxembourgers... how long do you think it would take until the word spreads and we would be the center of any homeless person in Europe?... It's NOT a problem of Luxembourg, it is a problem of global capitalism. We care for our people, but we cannot care for all the homeless of Europe and Africa... Again, don't get me wrong, I pity those people and I do help them on a constant base. But ther's reality and wishful thinking
How do you compete when others do math & you're singing? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Hi I am india good Luck for you
But millions and millions of 👽👽👽👽 migrate 2 europe for better life  please explain.
Europe is the most racist continent , they care only for their race
So? They don't owe other races anything.
People who are homeless in every country, all say that migrants take their jobs and opportunities and yet we never see interviews of migrants who get a free ride. free housing, food benefits, all that. Show us some of those interviews.. Until then I think people are just unhappy.
This problem is every where in every country.
How possible 😮
What he said that Orban is terrible is true.
What he said of Hungary is true.
CAN CAN DANCE
It stated here that this poor people from Hungary so technically not from there but other immigration who can’t afford to live there.
Alexandria has such a big heart, much respect to her and i hope the government listens.    PS; Yanick is angry at French people but most french people who work in Luxembourg do not live there 😭, they cross the border everyday to work and definitely are not contributing to the housing crisis. I live at border city myself.
People screw up their lives and then complain about the government  ? Or these people bear no responsibility for what they go through ?
Apparently you don't know realities in work provided, the work for immigrants it's like warzone. It's no wonder that they choose to live quietly apart. It's just common sense of survival among inteligent people.
Tell me again we shouldn't redistribute wealth or better - switch from this horrible system called Capitalism.  PS: i would love to volunteer in a similar thing near where i live. helping people with even less fortune than humble me. this is so saddening to watch people struggle like that
Here in Africa we have got none neither homeless or poor everyone has health insurance am telling you 😭
Locals must not be poor which is almost always true for any city. Immigrants can always go back. Nobody cares
Only the country economy is rich....must of the cetizen are poor same in any country in the world
As Paul said, “The poor will always be with us.”
Housing is not a problem in my country  because the atmosphere here is very nice. We can build simple houses anywhere without AC or heater. We can find fresh water just by digging well. But we have a lot of problems concerning health , education  economic and others. Most of us have houses of our owns. ( I am in Indonesia btw)
I am from India and thank God Almighty that I am in far better place in India and have all facilities ❤
These are kind of strange people, first they lie to themselves and second to the others...
speculation is the main culprit for world's suffering
Heaven in Germany? Only in swollen and dranken mind.  Now... It is an opposite to heaven, for the rest of the people.
Whery soon Europe will elect a new direction. Back to European values and European culture.🙏
Explain please?
I've only watched about 15 min so far, but I have to tell you this story is surprising to me. I decided to research EU stats this past week. After a LOT of searching I FINALLY found numbers as recent as 2023 for immigration and emigration WITHIN the EU. Not shocking, the countries people leave most are Romania, Poland, Greece, Portugal, Hungary. They mostly go to Spain, Italy, France, etc., But kinda shocking, a country that stood out that people move to, from more firmly established economies like Germany and and France--was Luxembourg.   So this poverty/homeless story from only 2 months ago was not what I expected to find after having done my reading. Particularly since having seen so many past youtube videos about fun and interesting visits. But those were tourist, and usually not European residents. Still, I'm really surprised. But this woman, Alexandra! Wow, what dedication and humanity.
Social Security System of a country should be for its citizens. I am an expat, if I can’t support my family, I can go be poor in my country. Basta!
SAME in the UNITED STATES!!!!!!!
Canadian here, same story in Luxembourg as here, same feelings of frustration, it is world wide, we are all hurting.
Atleast Canada has a bigger landmass..They still can build homes..but Luxembourg is a very tiny country, they cannot build further
Eu is facing immigration from Moslems.. Canada is facing immigration from india.. especially punjab
Yes, we are all hurting.😢 Average people.  Sadly; despite the horrible worldwide man-made ( evil politicians' and businessmen) crises, why people haven't seen the signs? Why do still some people make many children? When there is global housing shortage/ downturn- that will lead us to like " Great Depression of 1929" conditions soon. 💔😢 World War 3 ultimately
​@@AkashPrasanna-tt3tnSoon canada will become khalistania.
*Hurted
No skills, no education, but wants free everything...zero help from government. Thinks he will go back to Portugal where he is from.. Good bye. Go home.
Same here in the UK 🇬🇧 this government don't care about it own people they give and put up migrants in hotels the is the laughing stock of the world Europe and the world
They have free health care for the homeless & people from other countries? I am surprised more migrants are not flooding into that area.
I figured everyone in Luxembourg was rich af
It's a country's highest obligation to look after and protect its own people, not everyone who happens to walk through the open border.
Noone wants to live in Luxembourg, so why is it labeled 'wealthiest'? I personally visited this country which didn't impress me.
Your aura becomes even better ❤
Why this poverty? No more colonies to exploit?
hello im from the Philippines
Country with 100 people living in a city complain of issues, funny to even understand these from pur 3rd world country India.  Like poverty and being homeless 😂😂  Yes indeed im laughing, these people cant even survive for a day in India and is complaining about poverty
No wonder Europe is moving to the right - not that the right has answers to the free movement of people.
Please don't use word a land of plenty........ we indians get harmed.......... they have looted billions together from my country..........
India is on a different level bro, it's a 4th world  No country can be compared on earth except some African countries with the level of things India deal with.

These European countries have such tiny populations and yet we find poverty. How pathetic and astonishing is that?
Wake up, humanity! These people are fellow human beings. This earthly life is not everlasting.
When I am travelling along the EU countries, for my concern ,I am seeing excessive buildings more than their population count,but,it is astonishing me ,while I am hearing that there is no enough roof  on their  head for their citizens to stay, makes me to think what these buildings  I am seeing in these countries are doing its function?
Such a tragic & heart breaking documentary 💔  I'm From Pakistan, and people here complain pretty much the same & prefer to go abroad and work for a better life.... But countries like Luxembourg are a red flag themselves...

Housing prices worldwide will be rich live in houses, their slaves live in cardboard boxes.
America is far worse!
Heard about India, third world country.  You guys can't even survive maybe 2 hours in the poverty area in India  These homeless videos looks funny from the perspective of being Indian.
Crazy governments and rich people do not mind about homeless people. We should fight against it.
This documentary was so informative...danke mi nets

Oh so this is the beautiful garden burdel was talking about
Same thing happening in the USA

Thanks for watching! We're glad you liked the documentary.
Wow! Thanks for taking our freeloaders xDdd cheers from hungary!
Luxembourg needs to learn from the French Revolution. Hungry, homeless people will become desperate.
These are obviously illegal immigrants and not subjects of Luxembourg.
Luxembourg should never have been a country.
Oh yeah, similar situation as to here in the United States, Creepy Joe Biden gives massive benefits to illegal immigrants and leaves the poverty stricken citizens of his own country with absolutely none.
The poor roaming around affluent areas ? please go away, "you make this area lose value” 😡
The government is not resposible four anybodys fortune. Keep fighting for yourself and dont als for help.
Them the government should keep their hands off peoples money . Go ask taxes from the people who have the benefits from them .
New housing will never go to homeless...cuz they can not afford to pay rent...low income maybe...gov assistance maybe...no where to go no place to squat...criminalize the poor/ homeless...then what? Fines jail ...no jail...that is too much costs...human misery a global enterprise...evil does as evil wil
Free dole meals , living allowances,a beautiful country,what else do they expect? What will they conrribute?what skills do they have
This so called activist lady is trying to get limelight as a warrior for a non issue
These are refugees,why doesnt the video make that clear first ? It's posing as if the Luxembourg authorities are keeping their own citizens in such pitiable conditions.Rfugees from all over,a Hungarian who has taken refuge,for example.And he is saying Luxembourg is heaven.So where is the problem? Are they supposed to construct a new rich Luxembourg duplicate city for these refugees???

i was in LX in 1989...and was already hard...but a beautiful boring little place.
It seems to be true, the foreigners are taken in but the locals are ignored.  Yet our taxes have to pay for that.  And those same immigrants will drag the country down, look at the UK.
You can't regulate a housing market, you can only free it.
Islam's financial Principles if implemted will remove poverty from world.. zakath is 2% of your income which shud be given to needy..
Hungarians who hate Orban: "- Luxemburg is a heaven for homeless people. We got everything for free without working." Fantastic.
It's funny because i pay hundreds for small fillings. I'd like to find these free dental programs in Luxembourg!!
@@ilsevanheerden4976 Small fillings are free in Hungary. They are called "treatments to keep your teeth".  If you go to private care that is max 10 euros because the you states pay for it.  But pulling out and have implants or other cost a huge amount of money.
Honestly I hear the first Hungarians who hates Orban… except European Union members… the one who protects his country and people from migrants… simple as that…
If he is Hungarian, how is he speaking German?
we need to "nationalize" the monopoly on real estate the only way  its the law killing us so use the law to reduce our stress, then ? reduce the corporations out of the shareholders pockets and make the ceos work for the company money,  roll back the government overreach and  poverty will virtually go away even among the addicts  hope
Thank you Alexandra. This is inspiring.
Two Hungarian men hmm so not from Luxembourg
Gee maybe letting in more migrants will help?
It is the clearest measure of the moral status of a nation  how it deals with the least fortunate and those on the margins.
the similarities of how the actual resident is treated over the non resident is very familiar to the US currently
This corruption from the goverments will end. People are waking up. God bless you all for helping these people in need.
People in Europe are becomming stupid. Luxembourg. Is no exception.
"Even if I don't have any experience,  as long as you can pay me".    Is there a job he has experience for but he won't do?
Another masterpiece of DW - to distort facts and give it all the usual communist woke wako twist. Alexandra, Serge, and the likes - what does Luxemburg have to do with these drifters? Why are they in Luxemburg in the first place? Has Luxemburg invited them?  Has anybody ever seen a "documentary" of DW going to the source of the problems why these "professional immigrants" are all over the world - just not where they come from? Why are their home countries not able to to care of them? Why are the leaders of those countries getting filth rich as delegates in one of the UN committees doing nothing else but voting to get "development aid for their countries - the countries which they are exploiting.
As a Muslim, i can tell one word. Our Muslim community has to learn from this volunteers.  Lot of loves from United States of America.  Congratulations to them,Who's are doing this  incredible social activities.
7 years? I call Meth!
The main problem with housing is that for 3 decades the population growth had been strongly underestimated.  I can still remember when previsions of Luxembourg having 700k inhabitants by 2050 were considered unrealistically high and those propagating them in the late 90's (when Luxembourg had bare broken past the 400k number) were considered doomsayers.  Now it looks like we'll reach that number in 2025, a full generation earlier than those "unrealistically high" predictions of the late 90's. Or in other words, the population grew twice as fast as expected. Granted, that number got corrected upwards, first to 750k, then to 800k, but they stopped bothering after that making any clear predictions of the sort.  The result: Social housing is in extreme short supply since they never built near enough of them as they kept to their projections. It got increased the last couple years, but after decades of "not near enough", it's but a drop in the bucket now. Also, most of those are still houses, which even with more "social" prices, are still to expensive for the vast majority of people - even with 40-year mortgages!
lux is like HK， Korea then

Well they have no where to go !! right
He he. If they cant beg they are gonna have to steal. What about working? 😂😂

You support this w/ your 401k because you want increased returns.

Go ahead and prepare, prepare.
We need to separate the really needy from the begging mafías. Is not that I don't want to share if I have, is that some of these people had adopted this way of living as a life style. As long as most people around the world act fanatically about politics and religion, no social issues will be solved.

How are 2 Hungarian men Luxembourg's problem?
No money for alleviating poverty but plenty for pointless self-inflicted wars
If housing is the problem, then for a small country like Luxembourg, the solution is in plain sight. Just look at Singapore and copy it. The Singaporean solution would not work in a large country but it would work for Luxembourg. Singapore is one of the wealthiest countries in the world like Luxembourg. It is a financial hub like Luxembourg. And it is a very small place (about 600 sq km) like Luxembourg. Its housing price has also skyrocketed. But you know what the difference is? 80% of Singaporean lives in government housing that is built by the government and is heavily regulated (in terms of who can buy, who can sell, who can own, who can live there, when an owner can sell, when a family can buy, how many units can one family owns, and even what happens to the house if the owner goes bankrupt, etc.). So for 80% of the Singaporeans, they are completely detached from the skyrocketed investment driven housing market. The ultra-rich can play their games and continue to profit from housing and the normal people can continue to live happily with a nice apartment. These do not conflict with one another. The Singaporean government has been running with this solution since the 1960s, pre-dating the founding of the Republic. It has worked for 60 years and this housing scheme arguably underpins Singapore's economic success in the first place, as people do not need to worry about getting a place to live in and therefore can invest their time and money in real businesses.
Same in every country around the world,if the govt has a good welfare system in place, migrants stream in to take advantage of it,they dont contribute,just take and people born to that country get left out!

I live here in Luxembourg  My husband and I worked so hard we are not a millionaire. But the problem those homeless people is not originated here if you don’t have address here you don’t have any help from government.
Its not immigration if its western europeans doing it.
The only thing I would say about the two Hungarian homeless people is that they are absolutely unrealistic what they said. Interestingly, there are 9.5 million people living in Hungary, but they could not make ends meet. Anyone who wants to work today will find a job, because we have a labour shortage. The unemployment rate is 3%. There are also a lot of vacancies. These two people, unfortunately, are homeless because they probably did not want to work. In Hungary, there are shelters for homeless people in the cities, where they can clean, get food and shelter, wash or change their clothes. They also receive medical care. Those who do not want to go to such shelters are visited by aid workers who bring them food, blankets, clothes and hot tea. Unfortunately, many people end up on the streets because of alcoholism or drug addiction. Those two people do not represent the real Hungarian situation, you should not believe everything they say. And to say that racism is rampant in Hungary and that Viktor Orbán is a bad man is simply not true. The problem is that in today's Western Europe, only those voices are allowed to be heard that criticise the current government. They are spreading a lot of lies about our little country because it is in someone's interest. I am very sorry that people are so impressionable and do not check any information. This is how countries and peoples can be incited against each other. It is very sad.
Thank you, very interesting. We  (family and friends)as Germans look at Hungary and we think you can be proud of Orban and glad to have such a politician who acts in the interest of the Hungarian people. Best wissen for you and your country.
​@@ElsbethF1Thank you very much.😊 God bless you.
Hungary deserves respect.
The guy talking about Victor Orban doesn't know nothing about politics.It's his choise to live like he does. He could work but choses not for some reason. 
Maybe that reason is rational for him??

Africans should join with Europe
📜This article, "BIBLICAL" for Luxembourg Forever Of Most Highest Standard<> Eye On Switzerland KJV* AMEN There Is No Pop"ularity In THIS DAY POPULATION<> THAT IS NUCLEAR DISASTER <>  The Upper Canada Standard
in Germany it is like this: there is homeless shelters for Males and females. but there is conditions: like coming in latest 20h. leaving at 8am in the morning. Druck and stoned ppl are not allowed to stay. and there is a lot of Looting and Stealing going on in the nights among the Population and so it is not the right place for all and lots of ppl feel far away of integrating themselves into such social Services
Such a good woman.. I thought the humanity have already dead.
All Africans should be allowed one visit
I don't think that a limited imigration or trans-border work is the problem, but that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and the middle class in Europe has to feed them both ...
Luxembourg's homeless has pet dogs that wear winter gear... Rich country indeed
so called poor countries have less homeless people as well
More capitalism, more poverty.
The only organization where poverty doesn’t exist is probably the tribe. But even then you might get a draught and you have to flee, potentially dying as you try to.
@@preciousmousse Absolutely!!!  Capitalism is akin to a draught.
@@henresearch Okay, glad we agree somehow. But what is your point?
Europe does not have any problems with capitalism. Europe has problems with socialism.

It would be nice if there was a country that welcomed working people who are promised work and retirement in peace and welcomed the next generation the same to keep the economy going..
Same shit here in Canada and the rest of the West. Immigration monkey branching. Local citizens stay down while the wealthy immigrants come and out compete them for common resources like housing. It's only the richest who come cause otherwise they'd stay back home ...
God bless people like her <3
All Africans should be allowed one visit for health care
Feeling ashamed to be poor or seen poor people?  No compassion but shame.   Wow...society of pride!
The foreigners can't grab the jobs from the locals who are really capable. They can work together. If things don't work like that, the locals should think about themselves.
Capitalism is gone chronic cronism. ? 😢 Social housing and social spending instead of wars and weapons.!
They must goback home😂🎉😢😮😅
God bless you and your family 😘
Everywhere around the world the rich are getting richer and poor getting poorer.  Where will it all end? Where  most of the poor and middle classes are living in tents? Unless there is a world revolution nothing will change.
People like alexandra are the reason the problem is continued
information circles, information war and psychological warfare😂
Lived here for 23 years and NEVER seen this in my entire life. Luxembourg looks after her inhabitants unlike very many other countries.
fairness & humanity...should be standard all over the world, but will always be broken by double standards...& rasism the like of Zionism can contribute to social issues
What happens when governments next decide food shortages may be a good idea? Lets face it they have created the situations shown here around the world.  Ask yourself what next?  The only people looking out for you and yours when things get tough is.... YOU!
The unavoidable conclusion of neo-capitalism! When the empire starts to cannibalize itself and consumes its own capital: People and nature. It blows my mind that supposedly intelligent people think this is a temporary glitch in our society. This is just the beginning and you're next!
Some of the politicians in Europe say so many negative things about Russia, but Russia looks after its citizens much better than that.
Didn''t Jesus  say "There will always be poor?
Why even work?
Africans would work!!!
All the impoverished men seen here are tattooed.  What does that say about them?  Are the unemployed properly dressed and groomed as they seek work?  I'm curious about this.
Everything is about money. People are not seen as important anymore. I expect the Duke has no say at all in the governance of the country just as our King charles in the UK has no say.
With all the money they have, they could easily build studio apartments for homeless on the outskirts of cities along with public bathrooms. Give these people low skill jobs as janitors, sweepers, house keepers, jobs other residents don't prefer doing.
Ah, the fruits of liberalism...
BS! Stay in your own country and fix the place up!
Like the Book says: 'Those who would not work should not eat.' Feed the homeless first. Second, make them work! If they refuse to work do what 'Crazy Joe' the Sheriff of Phoenix, AZ does; forcibly put vagrants to work!  
To the retired manager: You Sir are'nt helping in a small way, your help is really immense. God bless You
Yes, ban all begging by any able-bodied people. Issue a begging license to those who cannot work
" They take care of foreigners and left us" . Citizens whom father's Mothers  build the Nation are forgotten.   Save the Homelanders.  Greetings from Far Right from Africa
Immigrants shouldn’t expect to be taken care of 100% by the new country. The solution to stop homelessness is to stop all the welfare. Immigrants will stop coming. It would be no homeless no more
Africans will work!
7 yrs homeless? Weak people = hard times. 7 yrs!! FFS They want everything for free
I was surprised by this documentary about Luxembourg but compared to the United States poverty is minimal.  I started a foundation to help homeless and Hispanic people and I don't get funding from the state most of the donations come from individuals and it's not much.  I've been trying to advocate for affordable housing and a greater social safety net. Luxembourg isn't perfect but it's better than the United States if you are a citizen.
By the looks of lots of people in this video the Luxembourg state supports metabolic disease and disability, heart attacks, strokes, etc. that it causes 100 through a failure or refusal to educate people. What a backwards 3rd world health system. And, of course, no mention of how smoking is linked to increased mental illness because of its effects on the mitochondria of brain cells. And this is a "modern" country. Laughable.
I was thinking how on earth can Luxembourg have homeless people? Then DW shows us they're migrants.. no wonder Migrants are important in the economy for they will do jobs no local would do. But they got paid id so little.
This is what happens to countries who give up their sovereignty to incompetent bureaucrats in a pretend organization in Brussels. And it’s just beginning you can’t fix stupid.
Situation looks no good,whatever east or west countries,even the most rich country like luxembourg
It seems to be the same in all of Europe: governments do everything for immigrants and nothing for their own people. It is high time for serious change in governments all over Europe. Your own people shall always come first!

GREED is sweeping across the globe, at a break neck speed.
So, rich country, happy country is actually a myth 😓
How can this be that countrypersons Luxembourghers (sp) get nothing, Hungarians, Portugese and other foreigners get (it all?)  How has it come to this when 1 in 15 are millionaires??????/  This sounds similar to what's happening to Aotearoa/New Zealand, house prices out of reach same with rentals.  This seems to be a global problem, every country in the same boat, homelessness, moneylessness, everything too expensive.  Can we start again?  Why so many super rich and so so so many very poor,.  I cannot imagine trying to live in a tent in up to -50 degrees in the winter.  We're very lucky down here our coldest can be -20C but not everywhere.  What is happening to our world and its people?  Very lucky the Ghanaian below, who can give a house to some people, and he's not super rich, why can't these multi milionaires do the same??????????????

Love your work, keep on getting it done. 💪
Even the wealthiest nation in the world has homeless.
the elite speak french why the marginals speak german....??
So, immigrants go to Luxemburg, not realizing that it's crazy expensive to live there even for the average European?  I'd call that a bad decision.
That's not the whole story. I had beggars in my apartment building, they would come and sleep inside the entrance. No one bothered them. Yet, they smoked inside, took drugs and pissed in front of the door. Zero disrespect for the tenants who accepted them inside. Too bad for them, now the entrance is locked during the night.
The same rhetoric ALL over Europe but still politicians ignore the people! No more immigrants before the local people are set.
Sucks being out of work   Worse still Is the attitude towards foreigners, most being fellow white Europeans, speaks volumes about stereotypes there, Luxembourg  citizens should strive to skill up and be better equiped for theirs and the foreign job market, it's what we do back here in Africa and other places
People should not be living on the street. Stop allowing it.
Is the reason he says Viktor Orban is a horrible man because Orban doesn't allow him to just sponge off Hungarian society?

Stephen Hawking: "Dovremmo aver paura del capitalismo, non dei robot: l'avidità degli uomini porterà all'apocalisse economica"  di  Redazione, HuffPost  14 Marzo 2018 alle 11:58  Ironia e sapere: come Stephen Hawking è entrato nella cultura popolare  Non sarà il progresso tecnologico, né i robot a portare all'apocalisse economica, bensì l'avidità degli uomini. Non è nuovo a questo genere di esternazioni, ma sta volta Stephen Hawking lo dice a chiare lettere: "Dovremmo aver paura del capitalismo, non delle macchine". Durante un "Ask Me Anything" su Reddit, il celebre scienziato ha dichiarato che la disuguaglianza economica salirà alle stelle se, quando molti posti di lavoro saranno automatizzati, i ricchi proprietari di macchine continueranno a rifiutarsi di condividere la loro ricchezza in rapida proliferazione.  Se le macchine finiranno per produrre tutto quello di cui abbiamo bisogno, il risultato dipenderà da come le cose verranno distribuite. Tutti potranno godere di una vita serena nel tempo libero, se la ricchezza prodotta dalla macchina verrà condivisa, o la maggior parte delle persone si ritroveranno miseramente in povertà se la lobby dei proprietari delle macchine si batteranno contro la redistribuzione della ricchezza. Finora, la tendenza sembra essere verso la seconda opzione, con la tecnologia che sta creando crescente disuguaglianza.  In sostanza, i proprietari delle macchine diventeranno la borghesia di una nuova era, le cui aziende di loro proprietà non forniranno più posti di lavoro per i lavoratori in carne e ossa.
Just a fun fact: It takes the authorities in Luxembourg 2 years (!!) to issue a construction permit. The problem is, that if you buy a newly built property, the price _can_ increase between the signing of the contract and the commence of the construction. ( I have not seen this neither in Germany, nor in Holland). And the price does increase: you have to pay 20-30K EUR more ( due to the delay of the permit). Another fun fact is, that the purchase tax is 7.5%. ( Thus if you buy a house of 1.3 million, you pay almost 100 KEUR extra for the purchase tax).  And they do everything to put all the risk on you, they take no risk.
Thanks for the documentary but please @DW moderate the comments better! There are menschenverachtende among them.
incredible that europe is under a destruction ... political agenda to make poor and ritch become.more ritch
Still more lavish and classy than skid row
yeah i can feel that also my situation is worse than them ohh god  i feel like why i born in this world?   and people around me they act like helping but not
Yea, just keep importing poverty from around the world.  And then have these immigrants make a mess.  Just like the U.S.  And the ironic thing is this DW video can not even see this overwhelming issue.  Guess it does not serve their Leftist views. There is always poverty but whenever a nation imports it that is a recipe for a lot of problems.
How about in the winter!? However, you can come to my room, or beside my room you would see a family with 5 people in 15 meters square. It is very popular. It is suffering, but let's enjoy you have: food, tent, charity, ...
They are drug addicts ?
The country put over 16 percent of the land in permanent  pasture. And 33 percent in forestry.  Leaving 50 in farm land that isn't farming like it did 50 years ago. So get out of the green mask movement and build some housing.
The widening of the inequality between the rich and poor indeed is a ticking time bomb. It becomes poor fighting against the marginalized. The trend in income and wealth inequality has become a social plague in many industrialized European and overseas countries. Most Americans say there is too much economic inequality in the US-but fewer than half call it a top priority.
How is this possible in Luxembourg? Richest country in the world.
By importing poverty from other nations. that's how.  Figure it out. GEEZ!
ACTUALLY it’s GREEDINESS sometimes it’s not BUSINESS…PEOPLE wants MORE instead of SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY of TAKING CARE of EACH OTHER !!!!

They should treat their own people first.it is everywhere.
Napoelon rid the barbarian aristocracy with his revolutions but these monkeys were restored back at the congress of vienna.. they are not interested in using their land to  assist cheap housing means they are not interesting in saving their souls. In byzantium everyone had access to free housing
One thing common to most countries. They think their problems is always caused by immigrants
Not entirely.   But this vidoe makes it obvious that it is clearly a large factor. Of course, YOU can not seem to figure that out.
@@frankgoudy933 No, the video pointed out that obscene rent rises, and the majority of the land being owned by just 0.5% of the population. IE, the problem is the greed of the mega wealthy.  Many of the homeless in the video were Luxembourgers. Still, if gullible muppets can be made to blame immigrants, the ultra rich can just keep on stealing all the wealth.
Aloha, I am watching this show from Pahoa, Hawaii on the Big Island & we need to start a store expiring food to help offset high cost of food here and help feed the hungry homeless population here in the Hawaiian Islands. We have food banks but still that doesn't last 30 days with families here. drug addicts on meth, get more help than clean and sober people with food stamps & free medical help called Quest here. We to need affordable housing here as well. I think that victory gardens to teach farming to all people but will land be allowed? Will the government dictate policies to strict to manage? We are not allowed to have any sort of personal gardens on your own private property here. We live on an island one day that ship will stop bringing the food supplies to us here. Then what will you do to survive and feed your family?
why don't they have 20 kids and get on the goverment payroll like all the migrants?
It’s a interesting documentary. I’m Latin American and a lot of people think that Europe’s countries are perfect.  Thanks for the humble labor with needy people ❤.
Hungarian? Did they get lost?
I have seen a lot of Luxembourg, both in the capital and across the country.  I've seen a lot throughout Europe too. as well as the US, Australia, NZ and many other places.  Honestly, in rich and socially strong countries like Luxembourg (similar in Switzerland, Scandinavian countries etc), it is often an "art to succeed" finding yourself at the bottom of the social ladder, and actually stay there.  Truth is that too many people are unwilling or unable to adapt, or (re)educate, or are addicts, or... to put it simply - weak or/and lazy.  Well, those type of people mostly/always whine that they don't get a free ride instead of putting themselves together and find a solution (not talking about the criminal way out).  Nobody these days talks about the personal responsibility people have to take for themselves.  Instead, it's talked about leaving it to donors and/or governments.  I'm sorry mates, if you can't make it in a place like Luxembourg, just go somewhere else, where you could either make it or, if you don't...  Well, then lose it all.  Yes, I sympathize to a degree with the hardships of (permanent) social welfare recipients, and yes - one size does not fit all, but...  The sobering reality is that the world is full of more and more whining LOSERS, and it's not gonna get better :(.
Renting apartments is a tough, expensive proposition in Luxembourg. I live in a 2-room kitchen-bathroom apartment of 90 square meters in Luxembourg Belair and pay €3,500 in rent per month + €400 monthly additional costs
'Worst case I'll go back to Portugal'. That about sums up the essence of this video. Almost all the people they did an exposé on in the beginning of the vid. They were clearly opportunists wanting to live in the land of milk and honey. They'd rather sleep on the street for the opportunity of one day being rich. Meanwhile they can't even speak German, good job guys.
Huuuurdy duuuurdy! Their is no poverty in Europe! We have socialismz!!!!!
It always starts with " they take care of the foreigners but not us " , smh .  and i assume it would end with AfL partei 😂 .

Its a matter of time the roma realize they can leave free in luxembourg. And then ......
Yesterday I watched a documentary about the Slum in Manila, it was shocking to see people collect chicken bones from the garbage and then cook them. That's how desperate people in other parts of the world are.  The whole world is imitating the U.S. since World War II and that's why we are also imitating their downfall. The capitalists are telling us that things need to be the way are right now, but the trickling down concept simply doesn't work.  We don't need more freedom from our governments, it just benefits those who are already wealthy and privileged. The poor people are left on their own, fighting over crumbs and blaming each other for a corrupt system.  We need to stop celebrating greed and allowing the wrong people to procreate like bunnies. Our governments need to reform our education systems, stop giving parents money, stop overworking our teachers AND stop educating foreigners for free.
Never give people free things!! Give them work opportunities instead and reward them accordingly!! Only then you can see who wants to work and who are just lazy and making excuses!!
This country has the heights G.D.P.......this happens when you allow capitalist greed to allocate resources.
Yeah because in generous Communist nations it's totally different!  Right? Is that the "I'm a 19 year old commie in Surburban USA" take you are going for?

I blame Japan. they're behind all this
romanian here , luxembourg its not you re problem the only bad thing you did is you are in the EU and let people come in who take advantage of you re social welfare , those hungarians are there because they have free healthcare and they can begg for good money :d don t give them money and close you re boarders sadly its the only way
work for the poor.....DONT WORK FOR SUAR(SWINE)
I am Hungarian, as far as I am concerned the two nutcases can stay there. They think by calling us racist they will score points with Western people. These guys say anything you want just not to work. Tomorrow you will be racist for them, just wait and see.
Very true! They’re criticising Orban from abroad under the bridge!  Shame on them!

The only solution is to invite millions of refugees from the middle East. They should learn from Germany.
If only they had a strong moustache man to lead them out of poverty 💪
The lady who runs the charities seems very committed, but the government really isn't.  They can show up and eat with the poor and have a chat with one of them, but will policy change?  The Grand Duke says, "Oh yes, lack of housing is an issue."  Will he do anything about it?  It is all symbolic that he and his wife show up to the soup kitchen.   That is the most basic need of people.  It is easy to fix.  There is housing there.  Put a ban on renovations that jack up the price.  They don't all need luxury housing.  The man and his son are making do with a room and are in danger of losing that.  It isn't right.  There has to be a limit on how much rents can increase.    In the USA, if you are on rental assistance, rent can't go up more than 5% a year and only with approval from the Housing Authority.   If you are going at market rate, then they raise the rent all they want.
They don't need to build low-income housing.  It is already there but keeps getting turned into luxury housing.  They need tto halt the gentrification and just maintain the low-income housing that is there.
One in fifteen is a millionaire, yet people are all over the streets.  Some people are somehow hoarding the resources so that others have nothing.  People who have it good look at others as failures and losers who don't matter.
I was in Lisbon 2 weeks ago I've been some tents along the walk ways in the financial areas,  It is sad how Europe has declined to this situations.  This to be is the failures of the EU governments,
seems to be true.... good coverage
Wealthy Luxembourgers could really benefit from reading the Gospels of Jesus Christ.
i watched this and i wish i was a begger there,they are living a good life not compared in Kenya
Karl Marx predicted the. It's no surprise the European governments are so eager to jump on the imperialist band wagon and start war in their neighborhood. Capitalism always needs to grow and make a profit..its a cycle of growths poverty war.
its gonna get much worse and competitive globally in job sector more easy migration and hyperconnective world .
Just hand more to Zelensky, it was all part of the plan. Enjoy your freedom and democracy courtesy of Biden. Enjoy it. Own it. It’s what Europe wants for themselves.
The way it's managed, Luxembourg is not a country, it's a business. Oh wait, so is Germany and other countries. Have skill and will? you'll survive. The only irony is Europeans pointing out at the US and say look! Capitalism is destroying lives, this and that costs that much. But reality is, Europe taxes in the name of socialism, yet it's capitalist at heart.
Wicked. Thank you, Jehovah God.🏃

Indeed all countries have their own issues, migration is a global issue. It is a privilege not to be pushed to move to foreign countries due to failing system.
Your not welcom there ..understand that.
And then ghe Europeans mad Americans look down upon my country, India and other developing countries..😅
I think if Luxembourg taxed their wealthy more problem sorted.
Ever since royal and high old school society existed poverty for them is servants and medieval society so that is the way they can be called king and Servilism is the state of being servile, or being too eager to please someone else. It can also refer to a doctrine that advocates slavery.
Every country has people complaining about foreigners 😂😂😂 Always and an excuse why they aren’t living their best life but to blame themselves.
From  India    Housing  was  rarely  a problem  before 20th century . Poverty was most apparent  in poor nutrition . But , today  the  biggest  crisis  is Housing . In densely populated cities ,  home prices  are unaffordable  for  a middle class  couple .  This problem is global  and  needs some kind of  intervention  from governments . In Mumbai , one  big slum  is home of 1 million  people . They  are engaged  in all kinds of trades . Now , after several  years  of  debates and  indecision , that  piece  of land has been awarded  to  Adani  for  development . Adani will give  ~  300 sq.feet  feet  unit to each occupant . Adani  will  also  arrange  help and training   for small  businesses  .   Rest  of area will  be  an  upscale  commercial district .    We  hope  for  Similar  action  in other  cities .            This  is  an easily solvable  problem  for  a  rich county  like Luxembourg .
Orban is a horrible guy ??? I greatly disagree; I consider the EU elites to be the scumbags of the earth.
even in the great America there’s still homeless they don’t show you certain neighborhoods
Poverty is the rock on which capitalism is built
While envy is the rock on which socialism is built.
3:27  So he simply went  for the money and charities. He explained it openly. The tirade about "racist" Hungary was just a good excuse a minute earlier as he is a white Hungarian.

1st time I heard there's no work on construction, come to Bosnia and u will find that job ppl from Bangladesh and Nepal coming to Bosnia and work on construction. They get place to live 1 meal from employer and free healthcare. Nobody ever attack them and they say it's enough so they can even send money to home.
we live in an era of ultra abundence and incredible productivity and wealth compared to most of human history, yet there are people who have to go with practically nothing.
Much of it due to their own poor choices.
The government has enough work to do, never know that Luxemburg is in this way
Looks like it's better to be homeless in Luxembourg than San Francisco.
What that means rich country.....base on what.... economy base on tax... before or after ...tax....how many people +minority rich =is not rich country...
The plenty is for hardworking class of society,  you can not just do nothing and expect something to happen to you
This is obviously a global problem… why? I thought it was just the US, now I see it in Canada, I saw it in Scotland and now in Luxembourg…How is this acceptable? 830 usd for a room… a room with no kitchen or access to kitchen! Unbelievable greed in this country, this country is far worse than the US for sure.
A white Hungarian saying that his country Hungary is racist... I need some explanation there. What is he talking about? I know that those easter European countries are really backwards and life must be really horrible.
They’re not!
Come to Bosnia, 800Euro, for whole month
Why are you angry at the government??  Are they supposed to support you? Here in America, we go get jobs and take care of ourselves. If you have a drug addiction or have no skills then it's your problem
Are we supposed to always keep giving billions and billions to other countries. Let them other countries help their people out. If I'm going to give handouts it will be americans
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂YOUR COUSINS ARE THE SAME IN AMERICA. WORTHLESS
I visited gare. But life in Luxembourg isn’t easy or soft has many say it’s hard
what we observe nowadays is a trend of poor people that already were living in the street in their home contries decide to migrate to richer countries, but the meantality when they migrate is not to contribute to the sociaty but else to be beggars in other country becasue social benefits and "easier way of living". I think poverty should be tackle in their respective countries, it is not fair that a country that is making the job good in term of economics and social view point to receive this type of migration. It is a dificult topic, eveybody should have a second opportunity in the society but the state is not your father, this mentatlity only rewards people that doesnt want to make effort, it is unfair for the people that does
One day there will be a revolution to get back lands from the wealthy, because if nobody can afford a house, people will start to get violent. Or the clown governments should put up laws which prohibits speculation on housing since it is a primary human need and should be regarded like one.
Blame colonialism not immigrants. We call this karma.
The young guy complaining is a typical lazy dumb youngster who thinks he knows better than anyone else and is owed by everyone just because he was born in that country. If immigrants find jobs it means there are jobs, he is just either unskilled for them or doesn’t want to work because the pay is too low. Low pay is a real issue of course, but you have to start somewhere - maybe not put tiles like he said but work in a restaurant/cafe/anywhere else. If he thinks that being an immigrant is so easy, why doesn’t he try it in another country. Other European countries also have good benefits with locals complaining about immigration for the same reasons.  Sure, the world is an unfair place that caters to those in power/people with money. You can try to fight injustice and help the poor like Alexandra does, and this is very honourable and I respect that a lot. But if you are just complaining and sitting on your ass, nobody is going to care, you just waste your time and don’t move forward.  Being young nowadays is difficult, being young and poor is even more difficult. You are not going to get a job just because you think you are a “designer”. Getting a job as a designer requires more skills than just knowing how to “design”. Wish this kid face the reality, stop blaming others and start moving forward in his life.
The same problem of the government feeding strangers and illegals over homeless unemployed citizens exists here in America!
Thank you, Alexandra,
Men suffer the most due to divorce.
Jehovah, God say no to "poverty."🌈🌏🙃😵🚷
Voice of the Streets is an awesome organization. Seems like they are single-handedly tackling homelessness in Luxembourg. What will happen when Alexandra can't do it any more?
It is a state-funded organization, i.e. paid by the taxpayer's money. Plus, many retailers are donating food and, many people leave their old clothes for free.
I didn't know Serge well personally, but I remember his kids from our time together at the same elementary school. It's disheartening to hear about his financial struggles. I noticed his move from his previous place, but I never realized the depth of their situation.
Eu spends much of money on other war less on citizen USA is psychology unstable he do what is best for him not for eu Nation Russia is dangerous
Wow, I have literally just got back from Luxembourg, staying in Clausen but at my office in Kirchberg. Never thought there was such a social crisis there in Europe's richest country 😮 hope they sort out more social housing.
DW has to find a Hungarian on the streets to say what they want him to say about Viktor Orbán propaganda is not news.
They are migrants. Why is it Luxembourg's responsibility to cater for them?
Why are you obsessing about the migrants and not the 0.5% of the population that owns all the land and won't allow new housing developments to solve this crisis?
@@sanepillow59 Because that is not the problem. The number of migrants on benefits are.
Haha! Dental care for homeless? Go to Madrid, go to Paris, see the lines of homeless people waiting for food. This is capitalism. If you do well, study and work hard - you will get money and status. If you do drugs and fuck around, don't blame the government or whatever is popular to blame these days. It's ON YOU.
Organized beggers? What the fuck?
if you give them everything they will stay. It's better to let them strive to survive as everyone else so they learn the value of earning money by working and not by receiving charity. We are all on our own, no privileges for anyone
Why does this sound familiar?
Top world richest country in wealth of GDP per capital.
Hello Luxembourg! You think you have problems? The UK has a gross shortage of skilled labour; previous governments has failed to invest in the training of future workers. Instead it has relied on the cheaper option of foreign skilled labour. Now these European workers have cleared off home due to the red tape of Brexit. We’re left with an inept, unmovitated and unqualified UK workforce, desperately in need of help of the workers our government has gladly encouraged to go home!!
I’m just speaking from the title alone. On paper “Europe’s wealthiest country” means nothing. The ground reality is much different than what the stats tell.
People that do not posess skills or the local working language are flooding NYC...even if they find a job they cant afford to live in the expensive city...They have gone from one dead end to something even worse...Its insane that people believe a foreign country must look after them when the country's own people are suffering.
Hungarian golddiggers in Luxembourg. Why ain't they in their beloved home country? They say, Hungary is better than any western country. And cheer their supreme leader Orban. Are u fucking serious?
7:26 I would stay it's quite common that the government only helps it's own citizens and not people from other countries.
And the correct thing to do. Otherwise you are enslaving the citizens to supplement the life of someone that hasn't contributed.

Luxembourg just needs a few more tax break billionaires hiding money there with paying taxes so it can trickle down

Poverty in the land of plenty!  WOW! Greed has no bounds!

Mainly the greed of migrants who just moved in thinking they're entitled to help.

In Australia we have the highest number of homeless people per capita among the OECD countries. Almost 100 per 10,000. It is unbelievable considering we are such a rich country with loads and loads of mineral resources selling tonnes of them to Asia. Is it designed to be like that? We have problems with our health system, long queues to emergency wards sometimes three days, not free of charge ambulance service, no public dental care. To see a psychologist people have to wait for over three months. Just 25 millions of us. If just the profits from the sale of uranium were distributed properly for the nation we could have lived better than Bruneians or Saudis and hopefully also have the universities free of charge.
I thought it was New Zealand as Australia is 3rd.
It's disgusting - Capitalism in action.
No it's not capitalism. This is not free markets at all. Socialism is for slaves.
Yet many migrants would much rather be homeless in a capitalist society than live in squalor and tyranny in the socialist societies they fled.
😥
Poverty is due to greed
Due to drug addiction and low skilled labor.

I can tell you that many E.U countries have this issue of people migrating there for money. They don't like the country but are obliged for a better life. Switzerland is a country like that. It truly feels soulless
What a beautiful country... I had no idea it was such a wealthy country..  Sad the locals are squeezed out of working in their own country..
Yes, every country should take care of their own citizens first.
LUX is not Europe's wealthiest country. This must be Monacco. LUX is the EU's wealthiest country. I expect DW journalists to know the difference.
They are hungarians
Lets be honest there are mostly immigrants who dont even speak the language
i live in india, people help poor people much more then any where in world, poverty cannot be eliminated in world thats a fact.
Not true. People from one caste cannot touch people from the other caste.😂 People in India walk by around people dying in the streets as if nothing happens
"The poor will always be among you." I pray, hope and work to escape poverty.
What make Luxembourg so Rich
They live better than most people in history.
With one month rent of that s*it hole you can buy land in rural area in Romania, Bulgaria a.o. with a dismembered house looking better than that. If you like working as hard as you say, you can manage it, also thrive.
Luxembourg should change it's name to America Jr.
Maybe the one in fifteen people who are millionaires is the problem , tax the assets and savings wealth and stop offshore accounts/tax havens , if the wealthy say theyll leave them let them as you wont miss the wealth as they are not taxed fairly to begin with
< if the wealthy say theyll leave them let them as you wont miss the wealth as they are not taxed fairly to begin with>  Define fairly.
Homeless people with dental care and medical care?!? That’s ultimately impossible even here in Canada, another “rich” country.
After the Enron, Lehman Brothers et al debacles, I completely lost faith and hope in what society perceived as honesty, good business practices and leadership, empathy and fairness in any aspect of business or finance. This field is laden and mainly worships greed and the bottom line. Anything in the form of genuinely dealing and helping with poverty and the underprivileged is anything but a myth. More so than often such deeds of care are extended to the poor in return for promotion, which in the end after all is said and done translates into a financial or political advantage for those assumed to be doing it for the benefit of society. Nobody in leadership positions cares whether their subordinates have a square meal as long as their bank accounts are secure and overflowing. The human greed in today's world is mind boggling. A CEO of a company does not see or have any qualms with taking home $100M+ annually in salary and stocks even if his/her employees can barely make their monthly rent at $17/hr pay. The reckless unfairness is the norm in the world we live in today.
Luxembourg may not be experiencing a housing "crisis" in the traditional sense, as it's important to acknowledge that there are available places to live. Instead of solely focusing on building more housing, we should prioritize initiatives that empower individuals without accommodation to become financially independent. By providing support and opportunities for them to earn a living, we can address the underlying issues and promote self-sufficiency. It's crucial to invest in programs that foster job creation and skill development, allowing people to secure stable incomes and improve their living conditions. Rather than solely relying on constructing cheap, poor-quality housing, let's focus on enabling individuals to support themselves and create a more sustainable future for all.
price hike in London too.
It's strange to see poor people in the richest country by percapita . What surprised me more is that people from France and Germany go there to work . There are a few good people living still .who are helping out the needy ones. God Bless them 🙏
Wherever there is great wealth, there is great poverty. Luxembourg and Ireland are the richest nations in Europe. So this doesn't surprise me.   Alexander Solzhenitsyn — 'How can you expect a man who's warm to understand a man who's cold?'
At least the Green Party will be delighted that Luxemburg land owners resist the notion of the whole country being covered with urban construction.
"the law says the man has to leave the apartment" so, Serge, when will you wake up to the fact that white, indigenous males are the targets of woke government in the EU?

"worried by rising prices in the country" welcome to the consequences of Green policies, lockdowns and sanctions on Russia, honey. Get used to it.

Alexandra still trying to figure out how it is that giving the homeless more and more handouts results in ever more homeless people coming in search of more and more handouts. Not the sharpest knife in the drawer, is she?

Really great content as always by DW, this was very interesting look  into a side of Luxembourg most people never knew existed. I'm from NYC and this was an eye opener, I always tell people online alot of these countries aren't exactly as portrayed by the media. If you don't have a proper job then it could be like hell on earth to afford living here. I'm blessed to be born into the family I was born into and the country I was born but thank God for people like Alexandra, truly a remarkable woman with a huge heart, empathetic eyes and sound ears. May God continue to bless her with health and strength so she can continue to shine her light in such dark times.
It's shocking that such a wealthy European country, richer than in many ways than the UK. Sounds like the average earner, earns far more and yet it sounds that these wealthy people do not care. But at least in the UK, the government does provide hostels and government benefits to pay the rent to house for the homeless, especially if you are under 25. The UK does help. It can take more time to process, as there is a massive pressure with homelessness right now.
I cannot understand that there is no job for a 22 year old. Are there no jobs or he doesn't want to work? Even in Slovenia there is a labor shortage. Even more workers are missing in Germany. I think there is always work for those who would like to work. 🤷‍♂️
Last 4 minutes is a shame
Tin iron with water add salt and copper wire can create a natural cycle of electricity.
They should really reconsider how they are spending water when washing dishes ... just saying :)
In Canada it is the same.  People swooped up houses during low interest rates and now rent them back at extortionate rates.  Government got out of the business of constructing affordable housing.  People are squeezed between tenancy and high cost of homes.  You can thank neo-liberalism for this.  First south east asia was exploited for low wages.  Low tariffs made it impossible for western countries to compete.  Next people in western countries were the next to be exploited.  The same is true in U.S. and Australia.  Time for a major shift.  You could see this coming in Canada in the 1990s when Prime Minister Mulroney promised "Jobs Jobs Jobs."  A lot of us already knew the score.
Our economic system is outdated. Capitalism and the monetary system are too old and do not fit current circumstances. We are the most productive civilization ever, producing abundance—more than enough to feed and shelter everyone on Earth—yet we still struggle with basic problems. Humanity already has a blueprint for a more intelligent approach: a Resources-Based Economy (RBE) proposed by Jacques Fresco and Roxanne Meadows. All countries face similar issues. Perhaps one day we will be willing to recognize, accept, and move on to truly become a unified civilization.
The US and all the western nations are going to colapse in the near future... The rich don't care about inflation.. they just make more money... it's the middle class that's being decimated and turned into poor people.
<it's the middle class that's being decimated and turned into poor people.>  Thanks to government meddling in the form of high taxes and inflation.
Foreigners come to Luxembourg and get rich whats wrong with these nationals?  Foreigners get work. Look for work
Some nationals are lazy. They choose jobs. How come the foreigners are getting Jobs?
Aside from the highlighted poverty, please also add "extreme boredom" to the list of what you'll encounter in Luxembourg. I lived in Luxembourg for a few months while I was on a short freelance assignment at UBS in 2017, I was totally bored out of mind the whole time I was there. I abandoned the assignment and ran out of there like a bat out of hell.
How bored ?
@EvolutDesign   Bored out of my mind. Practically, there is nothing much to do except a few bars and over-priced restaurants.
Wait a second!!!!some of those homeless people are not Luxembourg citizens!!!!sorry but thats Hungarian states bussines not Luxembourgs!!!!this whole documentary is on a false narrative!!!Why is a Hungarian citizen living in Luxembourg homeless???he should be deported if he doesnt have a job and the Hungarian state should help him!!!not Luxembourg!!!!they are not citizens of that country so sorry this time the state is not at fault!!!!
I came as a foreigner student to Belgium and I earn a decent income here. If I came to this country with almost nothing, no network, and only onw of the national languages and managed to study, land a job as a public servant, and live in the prettiest city of the country, I have no sympathy for people who grew up here and had all possibilities and help channels from the government.
Maybe because you brought with you your mentality from India disregarding those who are poorer? You never know what happened to people. Don't judge them too quickly. One day you may lose your job and sleep next to them. Will you accept others judging you like you do judge them? Think please.

Great for you. However, only Cinderella stories are acclaimed. But for every one of them, there are a thousand failures. Success is not just about hard work but also being lucky enough to have the opportunity.  The economy is also far more competitive. I used to get interviews handing my cv into businesses. These days you have to wait for a job to come up, hundreds of people will apply and the interview process will be exhaustive.
This news is so heartbreaking to the people of Luxembourg. Their government didn't do anything to protect its own people. A lot of people have been including in the poverty line around the world.
Look no further than EU membership
Europe is now a dumpster 
The Kingdom comes, so be patient and pray. The world is already rejected by God the Almighty.
God bless this woman!
it seems the most of the indigene are too relaxed and depending mostly on the government .Most ofthe foreigners  coming in are well educated and they took advantage of the high paying jobs
What I like they organized food collection from shops which is close to expired...  well done   In UK they don't care...they throw away! Scandal..    I had a situation: shop at the airport was getting close and they started clean.  There was some salads in the box. I asked employee if he can reduce the price for me.  He didn't.  So I doubt buy... then he THREW AWAY ALL !!  Shocking... that's England !
Why can't they work?
Since they receive benefits from the government employers assume they are lazy and won’t do their jobs. It is the same here in the US.
Who care about german's life, German government is busy with other people's life. not their own.
Just because a country is rich does not mean it's for foreigners
What a disappointment
Correct. Are the homeless native of the country or persons expecting to come and get free things.
When Democratic governments  become inefficient mafia like organisations that does not understand the political responsibility, poverty and unemployment is natural.
Super interesting
How can one of the richest countries in the world have so much homelessness and poverty? Unbelievable!
Capitalism is slowly dying,a system that could tender to the many now can only serve the few lobbyists born with a silverspoon I work @ tambo international and on arrival I'd often hear europeans highlighting how things are becoming unbearable even with two jobs,what's happening there is taking place here,rent has increased property prices especially in affluent neighborhoods is but a dream for many even with a stable good paying job,ppl with foreign currency make it this side because their monopoly money can buy them more than the locals,the sweetheart of this is Capetown of course which is in my view anti-poor but high paid public officials ment to serve the many now live next door to these ppl so funding by them to their political lifespan often leads to in our case good policies that cannot b met and I don't know y maybe to frustrate or deter progression and politicians will often say we need investors but I ask to what end when it's citizens r on the back foot,a complete reboot in the system of Capitalism must start and it must do so in Europe and USA because I believe it's millionaires and billionaire are spearheading the cancer that's keeping them in elysium and the rest on earth and their citizens are made to believe what they have is better than there "africa" when it's their insatiable apatite for excess is sustaining the untrue narrative that the few want the many to believe.
It is understandable why Eastern Europeans yearn for socialism; some people dismiss it as a mere nostalgia. If wealthy Luxembourg cannot provide a meal and roof over the heads of all its citizens, it is proof the system is rotten to the core and must be discarded in the dustbin of history.
No. It is proof that some people are lazy and expect others to provide them a living. It's not wealthy Luxembourg's job to provide a meal and a roof for those just looking for a handout.
Don't get the case o José, why he is not coming back ? There is still plenty of work in Portugal in construction and salaries there are rising.
I agree, he should come back, it doesn’t give us a good look, especially because people in Portugal are complaining about Brazilians, construction jobs pay bad but he will get government help if needed instead of complaining about getting no help from Luxembourg government.
That’s just social security shopping… exploiting a country with more generous social benefits…. Soon all the lazy, homeless and drug abusers from all over the EU will end up in Luxembourg

How is this even possible ? I thought they have the best social welfare system in the world, being the richest country in the world of coz.
It's funny how citizens of "first world countries" are upset about foreigners "invading" their countries and using their resources when those very "first world" countries are the ones who invaded the countries of the people who are now fleeing after dealing with the complete destruction of their homelands. If you don't want a foreign invasion into your country, then maybe don't intentionally set out to overthrow democracies in other nations, arm their citizens and known criminals with weaponry, purposefully cause another nation to become impoverished, or systematically oppress another nation. It's all fine and dandy watching people millions of miles away suffer without even mumbling a simple prayer of all things, but go completely off once you realize that the suffering that you stood by and watched other people endure and even mocked, is suddenly happening to you. How about going to God and asking for forgiveness for not only your own sins but for the sins of your forefathers as well? How about starting there!
Eu officials refuse to admit that there are 95 million EU citizens living in poverty who need help before unauthorised migrants and asylum seekers . The EU foes not need immigrants as businesses should be investing in automation , which will add flexibility and economies to most companies . There is also clear proof across all EU countries , that the influx of migrants with little education and no social education are responsible for the massive increase in criminality and violence across the EU . All immigrants  convicted in a court of law in the EU , should be deported , along with their families , and banned from entry to the EU in the future .
@17:11 watch till then and you'll see its not "immigration" -- around the world housing unaffordability is pushing out folks who would work but can afford to pay extremely high prices that dont' match income.

Problem about foreigners is,employers take advantage and pay them less money and ignoring locals,we have problem in South Africa because of illegal foreigners and useless government
They need to bring in the basics! Tiny houses with solar panels and food and clothing and medical!  We must help them get on their feet and then help them get jobs in time that will supply their needs! WHY CAN'T LEADERS PULL TOGETHER AND SUPPLY THESE PROGRAMS???????? WHY?????
But, but…Luxembourg is stealing money from every other country.
wealth attracts poverty. For obvious reasons, poor people dont emigrate TO poor countries, they emigrate  FROM poor countries TO rich countries. So , thats to be expected, you will always find poverty in wealthy countries
From today I have come to the realisation that poverty exists in every country in the world
If a yt man tells me Hungary is racist imma believe him and stay out of there
It's not a racist country. That "white" man (Hungarian) is crying because he doesn't get free stuff. Like most socialists, they lie and call others racist because they want free things.
This is happening ALL over the world, rents keep going up and up.
Yep!
Yep, it's like the WEF and left leaning governments want to slowly enslave people.
The crisis of homelessness is a global issue and the west is the hard hit. It is a complex problem, with the west there is an influx of immigrants  competing with the scarce housing market, and rental values are sky rocking comparing to wages/salaries of people. There is the issue of greedy investors-wall street who are controlling the housing market and owns most of the apartments that make the average Joe to rent an apartment.
Not really. The real issue is government meddling that housing scarce and costly pricing out average people from the market in favor of so-called greedy investors.

7 years living off with tax payers money. Hungary is European country. These people could travel anywhere in EU and could find a job to survive. 1 or 2 years I could understand…. What is more worrying is when the residents who work has to take private insurance to get dental treatment fully reimbursed. These people are clearly abusing the kindness of locals.

Respect for Alexandra's dedication to help needy and vulnerable. Sure, shame on governments to turn blind eye on poverty, unemployment, and mentally ill or challenged people. But I deeply disagree with her attitude that squatering should be treated as legal. Of course that nobody wants homeless people camping around their shops, houses, and streets. It drops the value of their properties, and it makes a very sad sight. It is disturbing sight. It is upsetting to trip over suffering humans that are not actually ordinary citizens' problems.  Homeless people litter, urinate, defecate, bag around, and potentially steal. Who wants to see it below their windows, please ?!?!?! Certainly not politicians and privileged elite who live in seclusion. Enough of lefties "humanitarisam" on the cost of working class who is barely managing to survive themselves!!!!
The voice over work in this is horrible
Young guy complaining about foreigners coming in from France and taking jobs where they get paid very well as if he has any sort of educational qualification or experience as a painter and decorator to be earning those High salaries LMAO. 22 with no qualifications and complaining that the foreigners took his job that he isn't qualified to do😂
Alexander your doing a good job please extend your help to Africa
Yanek should not be angry with foreigners. These ppl are professional hires. What does he expect??? To give the job to them, who are not qualified??? He needs to get wt the program. Get yourself trained in a skill. Work for free for a while, whilst surving on assistance...then move forward. The same ppl who are training you will end up hiring you Yanek....use your brain.
For the older folks who have pensions, i wonder if it would be feasible that they move to another country where their money would be worth 5 or 6 times more....is that possible?

Europe is a corrupt bloc. All the taxes goes to a few upper crust folks.
When people live within geographical borders and participate in economic systems these poverty positions are there to be filled. It’s interesting what their clothing looks like and what items they have on them throughout time. Things like education, family background, health/genetics are variables that some people like to consider when thinking about these people. Historical social systems, patterns, complexity.
Drugs and alcohol are usually the problem of Hungarians! But they are also usually very kind hearted!
Never thought Luxembourg would become like this it was once very prosperous and beautiful
It still is for the majority...but that pushes out lower class.
perhaps the Eugenicists were on to something
I live in America, I work 64 hours per week and still don't make a thousand dollars.  I work full time (40hrs)for a County Public Works Dept and I work in a Hospital in the laundry room part time (24hrs). I live in the DMV area (DC,Maryland and Northern Virginia)  I live in a run down neighborhood where crime is rampant and the buildings are old and stink. I get no government help but I see illegal immigrants come here and getting 12 hundred dollars per month although they neber work and pay taxes a day of their life in America.  The entire world is screwed up

I didn’t think that Luxembourg, Switzerland or Liechtenstein would ever see poverty 🤔
Go back to hungry
Because of greed poverty will never be eradicated.
the same problem in the netherlands to few houses are built and most are to expensive for people with a small.
Luxembourg is the financial capital of Europe. Most of jobs available needs experienced experts, professionals with skills that those guys in the street don't have. Construction industry needs people with skills that those guys don't have. Moreso, it requires patience to get a job in Luxembourg. Luxembourg is a professional country. Without a skill, you can't survive. Most of those in the street are drug addicts from Romania, Hungary, France and other EU countries with no skills at all. Recruiting agencies needs people with skills that those guys don't have. Generally, to survive in the Luxembourg, you need skills and experience. Never expect the government to give you a job. Go looking for one. Most Luxembourgers don't have skills. Immigrants got skills and pay tax to keep the government going. No need to get angry with them. Go to school, or get a skill.
they r poor bcos of drug addiction
And poor decision-making.

This is a joke that they help the foreigners but not their own. Shame on Luxembourg honestly.
The west is corrupt and slipping into neo-communism. So-called "Green energy" is driving inflation and bringing hunger to the poor, legalizing drugs, and normalizing sexual perversion is turning once beautiful countries into sewers. This is done on purpose.
Godless Europe. 3rd time.
I was there in Europe when they made a hard right wing turn to cut benefits in 2008, to target the poor.  It's who they are really.
Same like Singapore and tengah estate
The biggest problem is migrants. No matter where they come from, they shouldn't be allowed to affect locals. Bottom line! If locals don't get priority over outsiders, there's going to be a backlash.
I live in a suburb of Vancouver, Canada, where we have increasing homelessness and poverty, with people lining up in soup kitchens and sometimes begging for food.  Some of them live in little campers by the side of the road.  It's sad to see that a place as rich as Luxembourg would have this kind of poverty, but not a complete surprise to me. In Canada's case, we have do-nothing government and a powerful elite who engage in real estate speculation - and they make sure there are no real reforms to change anything.
<do-nothing government>  What do-nothing government? Rent control, tenants' rights among other forms of government meddling enabled short-term renting, renoviction and corporate investment.
@@shauncameron8390  If you are also from Canada I have no idea why you say this.  We have very little rent control in the Vancouver area while real estate speculation is out of control.  As far as tenants rights I didn't mention that but they should have some rights.
Monaco has been peaceful and no war, citizens live prosperous there because of no war. Evil souls and haunting from innocent deaths and soldiers haunting nations that thrive on wars. History has always been like that. So to eliminate poverty, simply no more wars so these dark spirits would no longer come to claim via karmas.  Why India is a slump? It worships idols and politically it's a snitch causing world sufferings hiddenly.  Some People don't believe in God, but there is a Creator, a Devine being, not like what written on religious books but the basic principles of humanity must be kept, otherwise,  chaos and suffering will be endless.
Hahahaha!!
The iraqi guy cant speak english or german after almost 10 years in luxembourg . Crazy😂😂 and begging should be banned everywhere people do not want to be harassed for money
Alexandra and the retired manager and other volunteers are the people who should be the Nobel Peace price winners instead of politicians, what a big heart 💖❤️
I really do not understand why these people expect the government to provide and do almost everything for them. Can't they move their asses and find work for themselves just like any other normal person would do? I think they are lazy and are contended to just receive hangouts in exchange for nothing as if they are little princesses. When my family and I arrived in Australia as refugees from Vietnam we did not have anything except the clothes we were wearing and we did not speak a word of English. Now I am an engieneer( with doctorate degree), my sister a doctor( surgeon) and our youngest is a solicitor (lawyer). Our parents now owns 7 houses and 20 condo units in 3 Asian countries for lease. So work hard, have a frugal lifestyle, save as much as you can and invest in sensible manner. If we can do it, I do not know the reason why these people can not do it.
Thank u sir for sharing your story. U've done well yourself while contributing to your adopted country. Congratulation!
This is a success story God bless you
Capitalism greediness. The rich want it all.
Better than socialism greediness. The poor think the world owes them something.
They dont care .....no matter which government in charge, rich have thier own group,  they not going to let you in...period....I read somewhere in 2050, they ( people who control the world) wants the population to go down to 1 billion from 8 billion now....which mean alot of people are going to die
I read somewhere that u should shut up😅
@@Wazaarbazaar keep being a loser and poor
WEF world economic forum, and once you hear their plans for us, it'll really creep you out.
Rich get richer; poorer get poorer.  Time for the poorer to do something about it.
Revolutions do not work as the revolutionaries become the new oligarchs.
nonsens, in the netherlans you have to pay for almost everything at a dentist, unless you have a dentalsecurity.. which costs a lot every  month... So its nonsens to say in Europe everything is free Because it just isn't for normal working people. We have to pay  for everything, and almost nothing is covered by security.  #Bullshit
Was dude paid to talk about Orban?
I don't think so but all the stupid people and lazy ones love blaming Orban.
@@katalinrobin6222i’m sure it has nothing to do with the authoritarian tendencies and right-wing practices of blaming outsiders to consolidate power. No, no one can blame Orban for anything, he is perfect.

At last some news from the most unknown European country. Pour vivre heureux vivons cachés…
More communism.
Western Counties prefer to use their tax payer money to fight WAR over seas and leave their own people  homeless and destitute.what a Shame!
It’s interesting to see this view of Europe. As we’re inundated with travel vlogs on YT that romanticize parts of Europe with luxury views and the life of opulence people are supposedly living. I appreciate the realness of this documentary!
Ya is good because the poitician are hiden the real image,while people are soffering everwere.
Most Europeans certainly don’t live in opulence. But what’s new is a housing shortage ( and associated economic issues) that clearly affects even countries such as Luxembourg despite it being a very very wealthy country.
Europe is a boring, cold, lifeless place. if you have some money go and live in Asia, South America as an example.
So.. Going to the soup kitchen, didn't Yannick met inmigrantes, like the Hungarian men, that don't get more than him from the state??  If any inmigrant take a job away from him is either because ita better qualified, better worker or accept less pay.. Or all of the above And what about rich  Luxembourg emigrantes and  others that go into other countriand but their land, their houses rising the prices so that the locals can't afford housing anymore, can't afford to work their land???
Very funny country! Every things are written in French language, but it depends on who you meet when it comes to the language they speak. From the beginning of the video, they were all speaking German, then suddenly, some started to speak French. I understand that of Belgium that one region is French speaking, amd the other, Dutch. But in Luxemburg it's chaotic as i can see.
Poverty, starvation is a result of a handful  of billionaires  and corporations greed, selfishness, and  total corruption.   It's beyond sickening and is getting worse all the time more than ever.  Evilness and  their greed is their focus.  I do not support  any of their "I have to have this bizarre ideology" and buy only just what  I need  and  nothing more.  Buying extra things you dont need only supports and  contributes to their sick mentality.
No it isn't. Quit blaming others for your own inability to manage your finances and prosper in life.
Half of the houses is owned by top 0.5%, the guy blames immigrants...
This is a problem when your country run by oligarchs, same with singapore.singaporean are poor asking donations from migrant billionaires.
Alexandra and her organisation are a godsend to humanity.
these people have a better life than me 😭
It's understandable that some locals may fall on hard times, but I'm not sure how foreigners are even allowed into the country unless they have a secure, well paying job or souce of income.
Me me me me, more for me me me.
Prosperity is usually short lived, poverty is eternal.  Wealth created by hard work of generations of smart and conscientious people , can be very quickly squandered by the stupid and short sighted politicians and the ‘good-doers’ who think that you can print wealth at will.  Countries like this one, sooner or later will be overrun and looted by hordes of immigrants with different religion, and set of ethics. To the point , that the native will be scared to walk down their streets and parks. Borders are made in order to protect the people and their livelihoods of any given community/country.  When they are destroyed, the good local people suffer.
All countries need poor people to function. That's how it's set up. Rich people don't clean toilets, dig ditches, baby sit, or wipe old people's butts in hospices. So next time you see "those people invading our country," thank them for doing what you yourselves think you're above doing.
Stop inviting guests to the table when some people already sitting around it can barely manage to get some crumbs to eat.
​​I was shocked Europe will fall. Was it wrong to tear down the Berlin Wall ? Is the EU no longer able to help Eastern European countries modernize ? 🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁
Eastern Europe will modernize when the people stop relying on the government to solve all of their personal problems and allowing themselves to be governed by descendants, beneficiaries and ex-members of the old communist guard responsible for running their society in to the ground.
It’s a horrible story but they were Hungarian so isn’t it a Hungarian story?
So people living there do not want drug addicts that poop on the streets and steal from people? Imagine that... how rude  And the majority of the homeless are immigrants.  Imagine if i walked to turkey and started to make demands.. Give me this and that..
These days in Indian market immigration of Luxembourg is rising day by day lots of advertising on social media about visa cheap flights
How nice of other countries to export their drug users, thiefs and squatters.
The fallout of their socialist experiments.
Ugandans will blame poverty on their president instead of working 😅😅 forgetting that poverty is everywhere no matter the economy
I’m so over the whiners. Maybe the kid isn’t getting a job because of his piercings and attitude. Or the lack of spending on construction and painting. He doesn’t even have experience. I’m American and had to work retail with a degree until the economy recovered. I never blamed immigrants.
Immigration is key to destroying middle and working classes.  You let cheap immigrants in to do more work cheaper then your underclasses working class and middle class blame the immigrants who've been used and abused not the government nor the businesses making the profits and rules for themselves to keep most wealth...
Used drugs, and now blame government?
Where are poor foreigners better off than in Luxembourg?
Keep sending billions to Ukraine
Democratic governments are nothing but a scam! CHINA is trying to show everyone! China is not the bad guy! Look at your democratic governments  LEECHES!!! They can spend their own money, not mine
Canada 🇨🇦 just donated 97 million to FIFA, that could have been used to make apartments for people that don’t make so much money or have no jobs, instead they’ll waste their money on SHELTERS employed by ✊🏾 and you get your stuff stolen when you sleep or go out for food
It’s not just LUXEMBOURG 🇱🇺, it’s CANADA 🇨🇦 AND AMERICA 🇺🇸 TOO!! Look 👀 at the DEMOCRATIC countries WASTE MONEY 💰 YOU CAN NEVER SEE WHERE IT GOES AND IT WILL NEVER BE IN YOUR POCKET AGAIN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS ARE LEECHES  Leech money 💰 from everyone! And then they throw it away on stupid stuff, the Canadian government is donating 97 million to FIFA. That could make people homes or apartments and get people less fortunate housing NOT SHADY SHELTERS employed by ✊🏾 members that steal their belongings when they are out or when they sleep, THOSE PLACES CREATED BY THE governments are a scam !
He is a Hungarian person then why is he speaking Russian?
He’s speaking German
Some folks think that if they go to a "rich" country, they should become rich too, as if that country and its people owe them everything 🙄😏
Just the same as here in the United States. The illegal immigrants watch too much television and Hollywood cinema. They think that life is like it is in the movies. When the Latin Americans and the west Africans come here and find out they have to work and nothing is cheap, they call us "racist"
Not the case at all!
People use drugs are alway lack of accountability
Yet, sending billions 💸 to Ukraine and Isreal to fuel Wars. 🤦‍♂️🤦🏻‍♀️🤷‍♂️
If you want to work you can always find a job instead of being a parasite.
God bless Alexander. beautiful lady with a beautiful heart .
Does it seem like a plan? Take care of foreigners but not our own government? It is! In every country. Sweden the same. From eight to ten millions in short time. Stop voting on the old system....
Worldwide poverty ..homelessness.... Shortage of  homes??......money spent on other projects??
😂😂😂😂 Europeans victimizing itself is wild to me
19:41  I could actually guessed that
In every country I pass you see able bodied young men and women not working or choosing what they want to work yet lamenting that government has forsaken them and is supporting foreigners.  Yes there’s refugees that come in and abuse the system… yes there’s refugees that stay at home and have many babies.. myself I’m a woman & I come from poverty so I’d never ever put my future solely in government..  I take the help when it’s offer but I’m always trying to learn what I can do to propel myself to financial stability. I’ve worked with refugees & some of the places & accommodations they’re house in I’d never be comfortable living in & I always advise them that if they are a big family they can work very hard, save put their money together & buy a house in a decent neighborhood.   They can put their money towards start a business. The problem is that as soon as people get comfortable they forget about the dreams they had, start taking drugs, live lavishly until they’ve wasted their youth.   As you get older there’s only so many hours in a day that you can work.. you get irritable very quickly. Use your youth wisely and work the jobs you don’t want to work when you’re older. Never stop educating yourself either. Keep your body & mind free from drugs and also learn to pray, meditate & fast occasionally to center your mind and body…
I’m an African woman from Kenya originally but now USC.. when I left Kenya I first lived in SA(South Africa) for 7 years. I went to school daytime & evenings I waitressed.  On holidays I traveled to US & worked nonstop.  When school was back in session I was back in SA working nonstop with mayb one day off in a week. And that one day sometimes I did a modeling shoot.. All my time in SA I heard South Africans complain about their government giving foreigners money. I never received a dime from SA governments. Some students were on scholarship from Namibia, Mozambique, Lesotho, Swaziland, Rwanda, Botswana etc.  There were South African students who applied themselves got scholarships. The rest of us had to forefeit fun in exchange for stability & ability to eat, live & have a better chance at the future. I saved money, went back to Kenya & then US. I rinsed & repeated the process. Unless your last name is one of the one percent( Trump, Bezos, Zuckerberg etc) you have to work hard and then save money and start working smart.  I know an Uber driver that drove nonstop for 7 years. Now he buys houses & furnishes them then rents them per room. In next 2 years he won’t have to drive Uber anymore as he’s about to purchase his 5 th house.
Northern Europe has a problem with their humanity.
Europe will become a third world continent in 4 decades.
Alexandria is a rare gem - God bless her ❤
Nobody cares about Luxembourgers. It is all about immigrants now 😢
Get a life
Left wing politicians killed own people to feed the refugees, illegal immigrants,  and war.
Even Luxembourg are replacing their natives.
Islam teaches us to make a balance in the society as people have to pay 2.5% of their wealth to poor
My former boss a Pakistani Shafquat Majeed is in prison for 10 years for a 16 million tax fraud. Wonder if he gave 2.5% we never ever got any bonus at Christmas
Stop flooding your countries with illegal immigrants, and help your own people.
O yes ur people are busy funding wars around the world
"they live under a bridge" - maybe they should fk off back to hungary?
When are people going to realise that the world is in a severe economic crisis and the concept of billionaires is outrageous, while average people are barely making their bills.  Complaining about other average people bettering themselves is absurd!!… it’s the Uber-wealthy who should be doing more to help others.  We in the UK accept a King that rides around in a golden carriage & has an empire with trillions of stolen goods, while average people can’t pay for food and housing! THE PROBLEM IS THE UBER-WEALTHY STEALING OUR DIGNITY FROM US, not educated or skilled workers!
The wealthy are “culling” the human population:  *No low-income housing *Decrepit healthcare  *Joblessness  *Militarized police *Homelessness ruled as “loitering” *Politicians disdain for people struggling with a poverty that the 1% created!
Nice presentations 👍💐 God bless the poor and meek 🤲🌻🤎
I visited here, having heard of how "rich"and " beautifull" the place was and was sadly disappointed. It was the dullest, most boring, souless place id ever been to. Unsocial people, No vibe, dull culture if any. Corperate weath does not equate to a rich society. I learnt that  having money does not make a place interesting, its the people, the culture, food , weather. I think Asia/ Carribean/ Mediterranean/ Africa are way more fun and educative than this grave yard. The transport system was good though.
I'm from Lux and I agree. I moved to Indonesia
Can anyone tell me what the hell all those folks are doing there if they can do the same or even better in their native countries?
05:39 "Most of the people in need have a migrant background..."  That said enough...
Thatcher and Reagan at the beginning of the 80s laid the foundations for the degeneration of capitalism into unbridled liberalism for the destruction of the real economy in favor of privatizations which soon transformed into a pure financial economy that doesn't give a damn about people's needs. Another more recent cause is the German dictatorship in Europe which drained enormous resources from Europe into Germany to finance the enormous costs of reunification and realize the ever-present German desire for power in Europe.
Thatcher and Reagan came to being to clean up mess left behind by Wilson, Callaghan and Carter's disastrous economic policies.
Crazy how full of sympathy this comment section is, considering that the homeless EU citizens can simply go back home to nice warm houses anytime they want. They say so themselves. But if these were Afghans or Syrians nothing to go home to the comment section would be full of nothing but rage and blame
If you drive a Toyota in Africa that only requires the usual servicing and no repairs, do not emigrate to some "developed" country. You'll not enjoy a lifestyle upgrade. You're already in the top 4% in a country like Kenya.  Be warned.
No where cool they say! I now appreciate my life in Ghana.
Alexandra is one of a kind. What a hero woman.
Well Luxembourg sounds very much like the UK then, give everything to immigrants and fxck all to to Thayer own people like freezing state pension when thay decide to live in a different country because thay can't afford to live in the country that were born in.

Stop the workers’ free market and all forms of immigration.  The people of the country cannot be left to die.
Alexandra you're an angel.  God bless you.
My co-worker from Romania swears up in down that there is no poverty in Europe. She said white people don't live like that, of course I didn't believe her.
Just out of curiosity, were the homeless people speaking Letzbuergesch (Luxembourgish) or German?
Lëtzebürgesch.

One word: Capitalism.
Ashamed Ashamed on you shame shame on you
Capitalist has no conscious...He is blind.
Are you serious? That 22 yrs old kid cannot find a job and he is asking for a state wellfare? This is a joke, right?
I see these people and I cannot feel sorry for them, I mean the Hungarian guy prefers to be a hobo in Luxembourg than to work in Netherlands for example where he could easily find a job that provides accommodation. Myself I was an expat in the region for couple of years but I’ve never been without work for more than one month. I’m sorry but I can’t feel sorry for these people.
NEITHER DO I FEEL SORRY FOR THEM.  THOSE 2 WERE BORN LAZY AND DIE LAZY.

Money loundry country
Good intentions are free but the actual act of helping the poor is not. Unless you have the means with the intentions then feel free to help others. Before you have the means, focus on helping yourself first. Do not demand the use of other people's means for your own good intentions. That's a flawed virtue. Luxembourg has no obligation nor should it be coerced to help anyone in the name of flawed virtues.
Luxembourg’s homeless have way better healthcare that the average American.   …..of course 🤦🏻‍♀️
Immigrants - Master degree, Uni degree holder and professional.  Meanwhile some Luxembourg people not going to school lol if I am a business owner who i prefer to hire? People please study use govt money it’s free education unless you are disabled! Crazy idea that people think that they take care those immigrants!
Why European countries include in Luxembourg they don't help the own people the Europeans and the help Illegal immigrants and fake refugees help your people first and then if you have extra help others....

But if you don't, your faith was all for nothing.  I told you the most important part of the message exactly as it was told to me. This part is:  -` 🚨 ⏰ ´-   *CHRIST DIED FOR OUR SINS,  AS THE SCRIPTURES SAY. HE WAS BURIED, AND THREE DAYS LATER HE WAS RAISED TO LIFE, AS THE SCRIPTURES SAY.*      (1  CO 15:1-4 CEV)

I DID NOT KNOW IT IS SO HARD TO FIND WORK  THERE.
The United States is full of homeless. Most disabled people get $900 a month to live on or a little less. Rent for a 1 bedroom is min $1,850 a month not including bills. So, no one can live off of this. No dental care is included in our med insurance. Which u might not as well have because med care is cheaper if u pay cash,
Omgosh yr comment is almost exactly word for word identical!!!!! 🥹😢
The  big divide ➗️ has been happening for years 😳
Long live the EUSSR
Luxembourg, the banana duchy....
Luxembourg, run by trisomics...like the EUSSR
It’s everywhere in the U.S. also.
Why you crying for USA . USA have better facilities then poor europe
I disagree. The government does do something: it gives it to you long, hard, steady, and no lube.
Construction workers are in high demand in Turkey, come here boys
same is going on in USA...it is calculated!
Great documentary as always! ❤
I feel bothered by the site of beggars.  Personally, I could care less about how beggars feel about how I feel about them.  I work damn hard for what I earn.  Those abled bodied people who choose to live as beggars gets absolutely no respect from me.  Not everyone is going to make it.  And for some this life is never going to feel right.
God blesses alexandera and team
I am glad to see that Luxemburg is happy to take care of these two lazy nichtstuer guys from Hungary. We do not need people who poison society. Please, have them forever. They will enrich your society for sure.
Europe needs to learn from China how poverty is reduced and middle class is developed. Zionists' fascism is lossing in the West.
China reduced nothing.
Luxembourg is a lot of bling-bling but there is a huge socioeconomic  problem that authorities (and all local political parties) just don't want to acknowledge. It does not suit their agenda. Its riches come from a more than obvious offshore financial system (paradis fiscal). I urge the reader to search for 'Lux Leaks'. On the same note, Luxembourg is also known for its money laundering and well oiled machine, very well backed by its governments. That is why they have so much money. Loads of it. Locals and residents are leaving the country because the supposed high salaries do not cover expenses, is particular real state. Luxembourgers are leaving their own country and choosing bordering countries because they just can't afford. Exception is the old families who inherited land and real state and are having a financial blast. Luxembourg does not have natural resources or other sources of national income so the base of their success is pretty much on that. Luxembourgers resent that they are becoming a minority in their own country but guess what, it is by design and their own inability to keep making babies. The criminality rate is going upwards dramatically. Everyone in the country knows that this bling-bling is just fake and it will crash, eventually.
Send them to Russia! Russia needs European construction workers!
to all those smitten by the charms of globalization and free flow of labour and capital, this 22 year old boy's xenophobia is a slap in the face. we may have created a borderless for capital and labour but this has benefited only the top 1%. the rest of us are struggling. and by piching the poor people against one another, the rich continue to lord over our resources and and lead comfortable lives on the back of our misery.
Poor people exist in Luxembourg 😮😮😮😮 …. I didn’t know that
But m in Luxembourg 🇱🇺 and I have accommodation 😂only lazy people want everything for free 😢
Merde allors, Monsieur Assenborg!
Lexem has been declared the wealthiest country in the world
Every matrix has a glitch, no matter how hi-tec it really is. Luxembourg is just modern money laundering machine and off the system individuals have no bussiness there.
I hope no one comes to hurt you instead of helping you.......the magicians leaders we have today are unbelievable
Wow thanks for helping.....we are sorry for not getting any ....
Greed of some people is reason why the common people are getting poor....They are sucking the blood out of the common people...
These poor people in Luxembourg are 1000 times fortunate and better than the poor in an Indian city like Mumbai or Kolkotta
Many of them are better than unemployed graduates in Nigeria
Also parts of kerala .... they eat dogs and cats.
Well poor people in india lives better life because india is cheap not expensive Luxembourg
Because no body listens when we say "2 poor persons marry then make 5 children, now we have 7 poor persons"
Sorry to break it to you but these men dont like it in Hungary because they will have to work for what they have!! Indeed there are people in real need but not those you show. They are able body men and should work!
exactly, this is my opinion as well. those two are lazy to work, blaming everything on Viktor Orbán.
Nice one!
Pretty much.
What a load of rubbish youre talking about.
@@christineshortman976 let me guess, you also don't want to work and will be happy to receive benefits....
Luxembourg will soon have to cut the expenses if more and more people hear that they get their teeth done for free
If you can't afford Luxemburg move away, go elsewhere !!!
There is high poverty all around Europe but media tend to hide it!!
But why migrate in a country who is not speaking your own language and expect that you will have more opportunities with that situation?! If you are trying to escape dire situations in your country maybe you need to start to change your own country policies. The country will of course prioitize their own country. This is obvious and just right. You cannot expect to be prioritized being you are not a citizen of this country unless you managed to contribute socially and economically to your host country. Put your complaints in check.
People are very demanding; they blame everyone for their failures, including foreigners, but seem not to see that they are addicted to drugs or alcohol
Or are just plain lazy and entitled.
Oh, the Roma, my brothers, I see even they are moving the operations away from the poor Eastern Europe.
I though the poors  were only living in America not in the so called   european social paradise 😅
Look there are plenty of empty property’s in these countries. But the Rich and Owners of Property prefer to keep them empty.The Governments could provide living space and support by legislating to fill these empty spaces and to provide free food really doesn’t add too much to the state budget.Its all about middle class passive aggressive miserliness and Super Rich Manipulation of the job market.
There is another story behind this. People who are on the street simply are looser and they do not want to work. They had whole europe to work, and they speak german language they can work, but no they wanna speak how they are poor. This divorced man is another story... These drug users another story....government should resolved your problem that you created?
The current European governments care about everything else but its people, it doesnt matter if it is the richest as Luxembourg  or the poorest in EU as Bulgaria. All of them are corrupt and useless.
The world is upside down and it is going to take some smart politicians to correct things. Unfortunately they are all trying to line their own pockets, everywhere. The 22 Year old native is out of work, unemployed, and can't qualify for financial aid in a country which, like Canada has no problem sending taxpayer money to fresh immigrants  or maybe to help foreign countries that have nothing to do with helping the locals. When will things turn around at this rate? Canada is pretty much hopeless now, but I never imagined Luxembourg was slipping into oblivion as well.
I do construction work..but right now there isn't any..  Gets ouside, 2 massive cranes.
To begin with, he speaks neither French nor German, only Portuguese. So, how on earth he could land a job in the construction industry in a country whose language(s) he does not speak? In the construction industry in a case of misunderstanding, people get injured or die in accidents.
He should take a plane back to Portugal, if true, in Portugal we still have a lot of construction jobs, also 1/3 of Luxembourg is Portuguese so maybe he should ask them, he can’t expect the lux government to help him just because, it unfortunately that he is in that situation but he should come back
The answer to the last question in the video is: China. China has lifted 800 million people out of poverty in only the last 40 years.
It seems that poverty and all of its symptoms are a product of the capitalist system.  Poverty is in all first world countries.
While most of the migrants are fleeing the socialist system and the symptoms associated with it.
Just here to read all the racist comment about people accent get over it😂
The only policy that counts is GLOBALIZATION, no borders............All by design. And we are paying for it.
It's because the government is more focused to invite immigrants from Isl#@ countries in and then they use the countries local benefits
These people are very picky when it comes to work, one have to be flexible and tolerant to find job or start a business.
Yet again another great documentary by DW one of the top people for documentaries and speaking about the things the mainstream media doesn't want to speak about,its same in so many countries and cities in EU the local people are paying the price for everything and the government are doing nothing to fix or help the local people housing jobs is at the top of the list.
That daft language is a bad mix of German, French and Dutch.
Transparency International's 2023 Corruption Perceptions Index, Luxembourg scored 78  (0=Best)
What will people do in the future? From Europe or America or otherwise?   When great technologies & beautiful progress is made for the species by organizations & companies full of people from all over the world. Will they keep arguing about poor or rich? Or being with their “own people”? Gate keeping their hubris driven views that holds them to the cyclic poisoning of the consciousness? Hiding behind ideas like ethnicity, colorism, inequalities of wealth & ideologies?  These transgressions against the progress of the species will be irrelevant in 1000+ years when we are on interplanetary bases & starships with super intelligent AGI.   People who battle about ethnicity or inequality often lack respect for the species & have narrow selfish foresight. I know they’ll be left behind when the future is being built. It won’t be a choice because the needs of the species & the expansion will take precedent.   Human nature dictates fear of the unknown & animosity via hubris attached to irrelevant hallucinations of purity or grandeur. But It also dictates the escape of such transgressions by the building of ideas from cognition & how it takes many views to create something great.  It is not possible for a homogeneous group to outdo a diverse group. Even if you pretend that diversity can be had as long as everyone is from the same continent or geographical area. Maybe in tiny battles, but never in longevity. (I.e the war between futurists & traditionalist)   It is simple calculus & game theory. I hope the gatekeepers of the species are left behind so that progress can accelerate. It is because of them that we are at least 100-200 years behind in the development of technologies & subsequently the species.

Shame Luxembourg......
Being homeless should be illegal and the country should be able to afford it if you become homeless.?
Same thing has happened all around the world. Need an international data base based on what the property prices are currently and before.
It’s sad to see everyone so well off around them and they the homeless are not getting any help.? That’s simply not correct in today’s society. What do you think. 😮
And what's stopping YOU from helping the homeless?
Here in the USA, we have ten of millions of poor and homeless people sleeping in the street at night, while our government hanging out hundred of billion dollars of aid to other countries for military and other assistance.. Just saying.
Blessings and good luck for all these citizens of Luxembourg
If you are a citizen/have work permit and living in the streets, you are an addict!!!! Only people who have an excuse are the too old or those with no papers!!
Blame all these wars funding from western governments
So sad 😢😢😢
it was great to see that my two hungarian comerad changed home and now they have free dentists while us who are working don't. without work, I wouldn't give them anything, otherwise Luxembourg will be full with these kind of people. Good luck to feed the whole world by yourselves. Also you should apply heritage tax, so the wealth would move around a bit.
I'm unsure how people without experience, or ilegal Immigrants expect to be be at the average salary just by showing up. This is not how any of it work. You should immigrate legally, thus giving you authorization to work, and hopefully making that nice salary, like the surrounding German, and French people seem to be doing.  People with no experience, should then get more stable experience to back your skills.  There also seems to be a lot of people that had drug issues. I'd love to know if they are from LUX, or they came to this new country.  They do derseve a chance, but I am unsure the country could deal with the # of people that would need it. This seems to be a mostly personal issue with people assuming if you're in the country, you will reap the benefits.
I think they should try comminusm, that could work
USSR has already tried 😂
The same communism the migrants in the video fled?
The rich lady was so condescending with regard to the laws of supply and demand. With regards to you can use Compulsory Purchase Orders to free up the land. They just don't want to and want to silo the money in the hand's of a few.
Every time I watch the news it seems we all speak the same language about our government. They don’t give a damn about us
I am glad you had the 'courage' to show what this country, Luxembourg, really is. It is hard to define Luxembourg, among all possible definitions, I would say a trap, an illusion, a bubble, bluff.
I thought this was Los Angeles or Portland Oregon..😂
Wow god bless Alexandra! It’s tough in New York too!!
I'm a hard working person in the United States living a clean life without drugs, cigarettes or alcohol. I don't have health insurance. I hope the U.S. government would give people like me free healthcare cards, but the government gives free healthcare for drug addicts and prison inmates. Something is not right with today's society and the world.
Poor people fighting amongst themselves while the rich drown themselves with the money TAXED from poor people.
A Universal Global Truth: No matter what country, the elites will always have the final say how the poor lives. Just a sad reality whether from a very rich country or a very poor country --- it is all but the same! Tsk tsk tsk!
Parallel's my nation today. Gvt cannot be convened with the poor - they are not people as in control of a rich economy.
This place crises begin the four years ago in name life and science, also with war against russian see result now. Sadness  see like the world change by whole a sci fie ideal of George orwell 1984 or animal farm.
Luxembourg magnets lots of ppl from every social class and country but unfortunately not everyone can stand for long. Just because there is no enough place/work for 8 billion souls.  On the other hand, it is place of elite who want to live in  Disney land looking place, the government wants rich ppl who never complain about prices. Deal is made.
Don't worry, they are there for exactly the thing that man said. It's heaven for the benefits. Why working when you cand receive everything for free right? Almost all are immigrants. So the poor are actually the lazy people most of them not all of course who are ok to live in Luxembourg for a good life. Anyway cheers

I really do not understand why these people expect the government to provide and do almost everything for them. Can't they move their asses and find work for themselves just like any other normal person would do? I think they are lazy and are contended to just receive hangouts in exchange for nothing as if they are little princesses. When my family and I arrived in Australia as refugees from Vietnam we did not have anything except the clothes we were wearing and we did not speak a word of English. Now I am an engieneer( with doctorate degree), my sister a doctor( surgeon) and our youngest is a solicitor (lawyer). Our parents now owns 7 houses and 20 condo units in 3 Asian countries for lease. So work hard, have a frugal lifestyle, save as much as you can and invest in sensible manner. If we can do it, I do not know the reason why these people can not do it.
How can you do a documentary with a foreigners leaving in Luxembourg  the government is responsible for their citizens not foreigners I guess
This is such a global issue now,  locals are driven out of an economic ladder,  🪜 places taken by influxes of foreigners with higher bid.
In Italy we say: a war between poors. Probably even worst than the war between rich and poor people

"poor" people broke into my basement in Luxembourg. For weeks they slept there, pooped and took various drugs. Took out all my stuff from bags and stole my bike. Police just took them out several times and of course they returned. Only when I installed a new door, they cannot get in anymore. The insurance haven't reimbursed anything. I don't have any pity for drug users.

The system is not perfect and some people will slip. Ex junkies cant really complain about tough life situations. Bad decisions create bad consequences that linger.

Just you wait when you need to compete increasingly with a.i.😂

Very sad indeed...the ...sense of "wealthy" should have this precise meaning instead 😢😢😢 fighting back any form of poverty, building up new communities where to host such people. Web technologies now are helping up creating new interests, new economy or new touristic atractions, street food festival, street music or artizans show, give them something to do or live for, give them tourists projects to work on, urban decorations or gardening, welfare is about doing everything to eliminate poverty, helping up being supportive and educate poor ones to be usefull 😢😢😢when human life is not Holy Blessing.. we have no reason to live, we become worthless 😢😢😢
This is the same problem in Germany all Former cominist countrys Rassist  this man is a excepstion. EU schuld cut the money to thors.

I think the >100k€ something per capita of these financial hubs distorts the reality. I don’t think these countries are as rich as their gdps show. Same in Ireland. That money that goes through large financial companies books aren’t all distributed to the people of that country. On the contrary these countries attract high paid expats which increases the rents and cost of living for locals. A country needs real manufacturing of goods and services, and agriculture to be rich. Being a head quarter of big companies isn’t enough.
You are 100% right!!
Yeah, I thought something is wrong about numbers when I saw Ireland's GDP is equal to Switzerland's.
I always admire people like Alexandra who in the middle of the chaos of the world we are now living in have the time and energy to help, Great job Alexandra. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

Instead of giving money to refugees, religious refugees & illegal immigrants, give the money instead to the real germans.
Wait, I have 2 houses here in Accra Ghana, a business, and I tend to wonder why many Ghanaians have lost faith in themselves to travel abroad to look for work. I rent one of my houses to tenants and so not even worry them with rent. If we all decide to be kind to each other, we can have a thriving world. Billions of dollars are being spent on wars, but not to help people?
Did she say 1 in 15 residents are millionaires. UK the homes are sky high. I live in a 2bedroom flat and it cost £1350pm, im a single parent and disabled after having my son. I use to work 6 night shifts in a nursing home, i have some savings, done my bsc and masters degree. But God had other plans for me. Money isnt everything but little helps. It is a struggle living off little benefit which doesnt cover full rent cost as council property are taken by foreigners, being British born i feel let down, i did pay into the system since 2013 when i had good health. For me rent, bills and food comes first, clothes and outing are luxury.
Yeah, statistically 1 in 15 residents are millionaires. Lux is a small country, and there are a few factors which falsify thar statistic : - Lux is a "tax haven" for wealthy people from all over the world. Many rich have their residence in Lux, but they actually do not live there. A friend of mine is self employed, his job is to look after empty houses for super rich who are registered in Lux but are actually never physically there. They just moved their assets there, and own a house there. You will be surprised how many houses are empty all the time.   - Lux, being a tiny country, is a banking center. These upper 1% of the people earn a lot of money - but if you take these people out of the statistics, the average income before taxes in Lux is approx 65K euro/ year, and if you see the cost of living, it is hard to come by as a single unmarried with that amount of money.

If we considered something that has a very useful utility for people, for example living in it, as a store of value to preserve wealth, we will start buying and collecting it and it won't take long to add monetary premium into those things until they're unaffordable for people who really need to use them.   Because incentives are there and all they do is just follow the incentive. It's human nature to preserve to survive, wealth included, rather than considering it's just their fault, greed, or sinful behaviour  Therefore, the best store of wealth shouldn't have any other good utility value, living in it, curing diseases, edible and so on, except being the best store of value.   We can't fix the problem of homelessness nowadays until we figure it out how to lower incentive much enough to demotivate wealthier people from collecting real estate to preserve their wealth  It's the game of incentives afterall. Fixing problem by fixing the incentives and people will follow that incentives and adapt automatically without any authoritative power to persuade or impose anyone to do anything. And let's be honest here, how can we trust politicians anyway?
I've decided to invest in a tent, and go live in Monaco and see what I can get in handouts! Full of millionaires, but the place is nice and hot!
Alexandra's dedication to addressing homelessness in a country as wealthy as Luxembourg is truly commendable. It's a stark reminder that behind the glamour of financial hubs, real people face serious challenges that require urgent and consistent attention. 👏
lol Monaco is the richest country in Europe
In America, rents are so expensive.  You can't afford to purchase a home due to mortgage interest rates and the selling price.  Homelessness is a huge problem in our major cities.  We have these same problems and the same people complaining about the problems.  It is the same.
There is also homelessness in rural areas in the USA as well!!
Same starting here in 🇦🇺 @ a rapid pace!

It's wonderful how there are still good people amidst this falling world. They are real heroes.
The rich is pushing up the prices of the rent because they control the property market . This is how it is everywhere.  That's why in history the communists comes and take away private properties.  It would be better if governments would do something about it before people awake .
<That's why in history the communists comes and take away private properties. >  While condemning the people to squalor and housing falls into disrepair.

I think is clear that throughout the developing world housing has completely become an investment rather than a place you live on and its horrible the situation people aren't owners.
Luxembourg is developed
Mostly by locals who came back home from making their money abroad.
Just for remember the International Work Day... omg
Soo rich but at the same time soo poor. I wonder when people are going to realize that the system is  broken and it's totally purposely working against people and serves only few. Current world order and western hegemony is without any doubt a big failure, not only for other cultures and civilizations, but for it's own.  This is not going to end well.

Far Left keeps bringing more immigrants in illegally, so yeah.  As if houses magically spring into existence in our countries simply because they've ruined their own countries.  As if millions of low skilled laborers doesn't hurt our downtrodden the most...  We can't just keep building more housing either you know. We're running out of places to build them without first destroying something else. Habitat for other species for instance. Ecosystems.  Other than that, people need to live in the places they can afford given their skill sets. You can't compete with people making 5x what you do.
So untethered greed is epidemic? And the earth is absorbing it all and dying at an unprecedented rate. What are we doing to each othet?
27:40 “Wealthiest country in Europe”, before that they mentioned how much every person makes “on average” - it’s a disservice to twist data to make an incorrect point. It’s a tax haven, the money supposedly flowing through the economy does not go to the people living there - taking that and splitting by the number of people living there does not represent the reality of who holds the money. That “wealth” is not spinning inside the local economy
Peek-a-boo
The housing, job, and immigration issues are happening in multiple countries now. I believe it is all part of a global plan - this can't all be a coincidence.
Government should take care of their own citizens more than immigrants.
As an American, I agree!!!!

Lazy Drugs people become homeless
Many Malaysia peoples working in Singapore cos money 3,5 higher than RM Malaysia 😂
That lady and her team are doing an amazing job. Who would have thought Lux had poor and homeless. .
Every country has poor and homeless people. Being a rich country doesn't mean there are no people who are lazy, drug addicted, unlucky, made bad decisions, with mental issues and so on. Maybe the past decade it has become worse because of the high influx of uprepared immigrants, but where should personal responsibility end and government care begin?
Every country does.
Just buy bigger car and live in car that's what I will do in England no more bills to pay 😉and money full pockets
Immigrants now go to Luxembourg  hahaha
This is becoming the plague of our world.
In 2020, 64% of children born in Luxembourg were to mothers of foreign origin, both from other EU member states and from non-EU countries. If it wasn't for immigration there would be no housing shortage in Luxembourg, it only immigration that is making the population grow versus decline.  So immigration is both a blessing and a curse to the country.

There is poverty in every country even in the richest ones
When you grow up in a wealth environment and you don't even have the curiosity to travel to very different places than what you are used to, it is very easy to lose contact with reality. Most of the world population do not have a high quality of life with all basic needs satisfied: Housing, functioning sewers, safety, healthcare, education, a steady access to food and clean water. I agree that it is very inconvenient to see people living on the streets and begging. It is even heartbreaking. Let's use that negative feeling to push us for solutions. There is nothing wrong in being rich but when we allow that to happen at the cost of millions having too little or nothing, than we have a society that doesn't really work.

As a Dutch person commonly visiting Luxembourg as a holiday country, the country side such as Müllerthal, not Luxembourg city itself, i can only say that this situation is going on in every western city. Also Amsterdam and Rotterdam. I can only imagine that this is a western problem. Not a Luxembourg problem. I can imagine that all major industrial European cities are facing the same problem.  As for Luxembourg. I'd take a bet that this doesn't apply to cities and villages such as Vianden and Echternach and Diekirch and such.  Only Luxembourg city where the money is at. So that's where immigrants will go to. This documentary is biased ass hell.  Like i said. It goes for the entirety of Westen Europe. With every major city in it. Amsterdam for my point of view is a complete getto except where the money is at. The rest of the Netherlands is doing fine.  Immigrants and drifters only go for the central hub. The same with Luxembourg City. This documentation is useless. It tells us something we already knew.
And as a re-comment. Luxembourg as Europes wealthiest country?   I bet that Switzerland, Norway and Liechtenstein have something to say about that.
Harsh review😮
The wealthiest residents of Luxembourg are immigrants. It's immigrants who are paying high taxes for those living in Luxembourg to profit off of. But you don't like to admit the truth.
Agree totally, there is plenty of cheaper housing in smaller villages especially in the north of the country, but all the junkies and homeless are attracted to the coty centre just by the free food and to do the begging in the city centre
I think these people are taking advantage of Luxembourg  systems.  These Immigrants are illegal. Furthermore beggars can't be chooser.
Capitalism will fall in our lifetime.
Ask why those in power controlling tax funds being accused of ignoring the SAME issues in most rich developed countries? Incompetence or not?
I’m from Luxenberg. A lot of people from Portugal and France are taking our jobs and we’re left in poverty. This is not right.

Good. Luxemburg was enjoying money they didn't deserve, including taxes from profit created in other countries. Taxes that were siphoned from those countries to Luxemburg. Switzerland is similar, a money laundering machine. I hope this will soon end and the riches get distributed where they belong.
<I hope this will soon end and the riches get distributed where they belong.>  Sorry to disappoint you, but the riches will not go to the people anyway.

The same story in every single country in this world. And people really "doesn't know" why... Our materialistic civilization is a shame, always giving greater importance to money and everything material before the human being.

Every system tasked to take care of these problems, their first instinct is self preservation. Problems are never solved, just ballooning, it’s a great way to eat through public funds while pretending to be doing something. Another example in my old city, Los Angeles, local government spends on average more than $80k per homeless person, that’s 1.5times the average earnings in the city, so that these people get a plate of food, free drug paraphernalia and to sleep on the pavement! Just writing a check to each one, without going through the NGOs etc, would be able to afford them rent food and everything. Rotten systems.

@miguelokada768  My Great Grandfather was the Belgian Prime Minister who was instrumental in forging the economic union between Belgium and Luxembourg. His name was Henri Jaspar.

All the migrant benefits writes over the human rights right in front of the low skill locals. Remember, if Foreigners get the job, they are there with tremendous efforts. Try to be us for once and you'll know.
I live and work in Luxembourg, and we are not all rich. I have a health insurance card, the same one as the homeless man, but mine works differently. I have to pay the Dr first and wait to get the refund, so i have to have the money first, send the proof of payment, and wait. I do work, I do pay my taxes, and they are high. The situation is degrading in Luxembourg
Gentrification seems to be a major issue here and anywhere homelessness is rapid. There should be government limits on housing, food, medical… increases.
Gentrification is a thing, because its' only so long that people are going to put up with blight and decay. And no, price control does not work.
So you prefer decaying neighborhoods 😅
Gentrification is not the issue. Luxembourg IS A REALLY SMALL PLACE. Hence the intense competition for housing hence the high costs. The vast majority of people who work in Luxembourg live OUTSIDE of Luxembourg. That's it. Not freaking gentrification.
Why go to Luxembourg if you go to east Germany it super cheap. Only 20,000 euro home. To do bussiness in European Union as foriegnor you need residence permit unlike my better home country of America. Sure, Luxemburg has better gdp per capita, but germany is spoken by 100 million people and has famous Public Universities.
If you can make it in Luxemburg, you can make it in germany.
If it's the government's responsibility to care for people from other countries, and people from other countries are free to come there, won't there just be a flood of people from less well off countries?
Among EU nationals, you are allowed to move freely within the EU and Schengen zone in a period of 90 days. Many use this time to find work. For non EU citizens like refugees or asylum seekers, countries in the EU have different rules about such.
@@lucaspierre9305 I mean EU citizens moving to Luxembourg. Why should their taxes have to pay for every Hungarian who wants to move there but has no money?
bad marketing for hungary..  always blame Orban for everything.. typical

@@Curlyblonde XD I mean it was cluttered, but I've seen way worse.
so a guy immigrates from Hungary and Portugal to Luxembourg, becomes homeless and complains "the government is doing nothing". Local guy complains, the French and other immigrants are taking the jobs and "the government is doing nothing". Well if they do get the job while some of them have different mother language, then they are maybe more qualified? Maybe? What about instead of complaining about the government, you sign for a course or a school, learn a skill and get a position? Isn't McDonalds or Lidl always employing people, at least part time? And then when he meets the  Grand Duke, he gives him an  economic lesson about high flat prices. Worry about a job, not a flat you can't afford...  If the land is owned by few, tax the land based on the value. That is the most fair tax there is. The value is determined by the rental price, so if those rich landlords don't want to pay ridiculous tax, they won't ask for ridiculous rent. get inspiration for some of the system aspects from Singapore. Social housing, paid by pension. There is a lots of solutions "for the government" but that also includes that the social system won't attract random immigrants to be taken care of. The country has 650k inhabitants. How many more can it comfortably accommodate without a job, flat, food?
At least a while back in the UK, if you worked in McDonalds or whatever, who gave you 4 hours in a week, you were immediately off benefits, because you were now "employed". Places like Luxembourg will not tax land because its whole system is based on selling investor visas, moving money etc. It has portrayed an image of protecting capital at all costs causing ETFs etc. to be registered there. If they try any change, capital will fly to Frankfurt etc.
Much respect for that lady. The work she and all those who help her do is priceless!
FIGHTING POVERTY VS.  FIGHTING THE POOR  Very different philosophies indeed. The last guy was blaming 'foreigners' but not the government.  Why!? Because punching down is so much easier.  These 'Alpha' guys usually have the education level and social intelligence of a cardboard, that's why they go after those who already have nothing. It's true that too people are flocking to Europe for a free meal, but we can't blame people for trying to better their lives.
Lol she makes 1 million a year. Just checked the company's annual statements 😂
Weak people blame systems and government policies but but strong people flight for what they used to be
I think around the world money gap increased means people who had decent pay already, their income increased, ceo, ministers, founders start paying high to themselves and they took away a big chunk of money from ordinary. govt. did poor job to cover for people. same high skill guy is being paid high by all companies but avg. skill guy no body cares.
luxemburg "wealth" is only due to dirty money processing, nothing to be proud of, this country is no better than a narco state.
If you've never gone hungry or slept rough, you won't have empathy for poor people.  That said, there's a reason immigrants do better than poor locals. And it's not because they receive imaginary advantages from the state. It's because they've seen much worse and use their opportunities.
That's very sad ! How a wealthiest country become such a mess for it's people ?
Few people are poor, how is this a mess for its people?
Very informative ❤
" Everything is free !! ".      Then they wonder why so many immigrants.?
I'll be praying for all
Please pray for me too😂
The growing wealth gap will only increase homelessness. This is due to the concentration of power in the hands of the few. Crime will increase, the rich will barricade themselves.
There is also the other side.  When high skilled immigrants, attracted by high salaries in Luxembourg, come, work and pay taxes to support the locals that doesn't work.
The first time i hear Rroma ,not romanian ...Thank you !
Is there a difference? Please explain, I’m not European so don’t fully understand the difference
​​@@thandisilec835 Rroma and Romanians are two different ethnic groups. Rroma (more commonly known as gypsies, racial slur) originally come from India, and they mostly live in SE quarter of Europe, but do not constitute a majority in any country. Most EU countries noticed a lot of Rroma coming in from Bulgaria and Romania after these countries joined it. They are often referred to as Bulgarians and Romanians, to the dismay of the non-Rroma Bulgarians and Romanians.  The problem here is that Rroma are very disadvantaged, with a negative circle of discrimination, racism, unemployment, criminal tendencies, prostitution, unsocial behaviour etc.  Almost all slum dwellers in Europe are Rroma. The majority of prostitutes in Western Europe are Rroma. The beggars in the streets are almost all Rroma.  I understand why non-Rroma Romanians are not happily associated with them. On the other hand, a considerable amount of Rroma have Romanian (or Bulgarian) citizenship.
@@thandisilec835 Rroma people are imigrants form India ,that migrated in Europe ,but especially Romania ,they are people that migrate a lot ,in other countries ,they left Romania and gone again in EU and did a lot of bad thinks ,pimping ,theft ,begging ,idk you name it ...and the most obious of all they are dark skinned ,and we are white ...But the thing is we romanians also migrated a lot because Romania is a corupt country but we are hard working people ...and we have also some bad guys doing bad thinks like every country ,but we are not Rromas ,gypsies like the popular term ...we are a christian people ,and dont like when the honest romanian is compared with the bad Rroma . Also they are not all bad ,i've some good Rroma ,but the majority is doing illegal thinks in EU ,also now we hear that in America...
Roma from italy
@@coricori1781 not quite. I think roma means gypsies
Denmark have the same problem the Danish homeless don't get help, but Ukrainian refugees get free housing and free monthly pocket money
As an American, I find it extremely pathetic that someone without ANY qualifications thinks they have the right to complain about immigrants. You have skills in something that is not in demand(and you complain about not having work). Is someone at a bank supposed to just hand you a 120,000 euro job when you don't have any qualifications to be a bank teller, much less a bank manager? Like get a grip, and get your life together. You expect to just be handed something because of your skin color or birthplace. Absolutely not.
As a black person, I would take my chances in Hungary rather than living homeless under a bridge in Luxembourg with a free heath card. I'm just saying, go home mate. Go be with friends, family and a dodgy leader. Why is every 15th person a millionaire but the place looks so grey?
It's like that in Europe. Very gray in winters. I live in Milan, Italy.
You don't understand. Hungary  really is THAT bad. Like, that man is literally from there, and he's telling you exactly how bad it is. You won't know, until you taste it
Hungary is far right nowadays, they pushed back immigrants severely during the crisis. I think as a black person you have much better chances in France, Sweden, Germany. I don't have any prejudice towards Hungary or France, just facts.

It’s the same thing in the US. Locals complaining they can’t get jobs bc of immigration. When in reality it’s bc they’re lazy, irresponsible, and want to be overpaid for a job someone else is willing to do for less.
Didn't know they speak German! Giel! 😂
In my opinion homelessness comes from abuse of drugs, alcohol and laziness.  In most cases its a choice.
Let's add credit cards, mortgages, and diseases to be fair to some homeless people. Many end up on the street in the US because of health issues and many do so in Canada due to increasing interest rates on mortgages. Also, many people in France are still working but have to stay on the street because they can't afford to rent a house. These people are truly victims.🥺
Glad that your opinion does not carry too much weight...broaden your mind..
I was surprised to see the 2 Hungarians sleeping in tent’s because when I listen to Orban he makes you believe its the best country in the world.
Those two Hungarians sounded like as if they were from Transylvania, just saying. Stefan is not a Hungarian name, but a Romanian one.
those two, stefan and Ferenc will ALWAYS blame anybody for their fate. depends whom you want to believe, these 2 hapless characters or PM Orban, who did a great deal of good for the country, after the left ruined it and will ruin it again if given a chance.
@@margaret-yr6uh that's not true. see people sleeping rough at the Rakoczi ter metro and drinking cheap wine.

This world needs more people like Alexandra.
There are people that make abuse of kindness and don't want to work

People all over the world are selfish and heartless. It doesn't bother them that they live well or even in luxury while others live without the basic necessities. This has always been true. Human beings throughout history have done this. Long ago, Kings and Queens lived in luxury while their subjects suffered in poverty. Today, the wealthy,  the politicians and elected officials maintain this same practice as the poor suffers.
Just like your comment.
One thing for sure is that the chasm between the poor and the rich will keep widening
If there not from Luxembourg they should go back to their home land

luxembourg is small country, why there is no housing crisis in canada lets say? some countries cant just accomodate ppl when they go, everything has its capacity. Luxembourg is rich country, and so what if you dont have job?
What are u on about????? Canada and all major countries are going through housing crises as we speak, because the system concentrates loads of people in just a few over crowded rubbish megacities where most jobs are, thus making land use on the planet the least efficient possible in the pursuit of “wealth” and “modernity “  Yes, Luxembourg is an extremely affluent country…. And as such, not only do u need a job like in any other country, but also you actually need an extremely high paying job at that since things are gonna be really expensive. Now, why wouldn’t a rich country be able to help its citizens that for whatever reason are in need? Well just because it doesn’t want, if so, what’s the point of living in such a rich country under those circumstances? Humans create so many bullsh1t problems that can be solved but refuse to do it for no good reason at all. That’s one of the reasons why we’re all do0med

Why they are expencive and so few - cause its small country with lots of people wanting to live there
The issue with GDP valuations lies in the curve being disproportionately high at one end due to a few outliers, which skews the overall perspective. A country's GDP does not accurately represent the well-being of the "average" citizen.
"If Bill Gates walks into a bar, everyone is suddenly a billionaire on average". Median salaries are a better metric.
@@DG-ie5ip  The modern wealth structure skews the supply and demand system, as excessive money is concentrated in the hands of a few, resulting in reduced monetary flow through the economy. Money must be finite to retain value. When wealth accumulates in the bank accounts of the top 1%, it implies that less money is circulating in the general economy for the remaining 99%.
@@alexnezhynsky9707  This would bring us nearer to understanding, but the data will still be distorted by those earning exorbitant salaries, which is not comparable to the income of hourly workers. Salaried employees have a predetermined income, whereas hourly laborers must clock in daily and will not earn more than their scheduled hours. A single figure is insufficient; a comprehensive set of metrics is necessary to clarify the economic standing of the entire population.

Let’s remember that Europe is the most prosperous continent currently, and yet, life conditions are dire due to how broken humanity is.   Now, imagine how bad third world regions like Latin America, Africa and South Asia have it?

​@shauncameron8390 you're right, they shouldn't.  It's not as if the government taxes everyone (which is theft btw), and gives the excuse that they're doing it PRECISELY TO HELP ITS CITIZENS.  If the government isn't willing to help the people, why have a government then....
Meanwhile in the Philippines...
In what way are they responsible for other countries' homeless people? I don't understand. I can't simply move to another country and reasonably expect everything for free. This needs more regulation. The open borders of the EU was a mistake.
Open borders of EU exist to ensure that EU citizens can move to other countries to benefit themselves.   If Hungarian poor or Portuguese poor think that in Luxembourg they will receive better social facilities, then it is completely legal for them to move to Luxembourg.
@@asmirann3636 Every EU country has the right to deport other EU nationals who become a burden on the welfare system during the first 3 months. There are other rules to avoid social security shopping.
@Vilatkahang UK refused to deport EU nationals who never worked because it fit the political narrative. EU rules did not prevent that.
​@asmirann3636 not exactly true. EU citizens can move about. I've relocated and needed to register my purpose to live in a new country. Give proof of ability to sustain myself, address, etc. I am confused by this. The Portuguese man didn't do his research first. He should go back to Portugal or find work in another country.
​@@asmirann3636  You are factually wrong. The right of residence does not apply for people without a job, income, wealth or a family member with those things. You get 3 months of automatic right of stay after that you are staying illegally. Countries cannot deport you without a proper reason though, like being a criminal or disturbing the peace.

All for me, and none for you mentality has this side-effect.
There's a housing shortage and poverty world wide. Landlords buy homes to profit and the super rich don't pay what is needed in order for people to earn a decent living. I say to my daughter often as we are currently living in a house share, that we will move wherever we have to go, and I don't care where until we can save for our own home.

If this is true, it means that the government is actively contributing to a situation in which its own native population can't afford to live in their own country anymore.

Don't worry they have such prizes very much in their sight as principal goals
The problem is that the centers like Alexandra's are built in the most expensive part of the country in the very centre of the capital. This attracts homeless people and drug users from all over the country. Of course there will be no affordable housing in the centre of the capital. It is like complaining that no affordable housing is built next to the Big Ben or the Eiffel Tower. There is plenty of affordable accomodation in other small towns of Luxembourg, especially in the north of the country. Why not build a centre there? I do not understand why all the homeless and poor people must stay only in the city center. A lot of ordinary people who work in Luxembourg cannot afford to buy or rent a property in the city center so they commute from other parts of the country or from across the border.

​@@lerm4676Sadly, that should be the way it happens, but it just doesn't work out that way.  The rich employ accountants that know every trick in the book and find multiple ways of claiming tax back  You buy a car to run your kids to school. That money comes out of your pocket, and stays out.  A rich person buys a car at 10 times the price, writes it off as expenses, tell the tax man it's for business purposes - and gives it to his trophy wife as a runaround. Having bought a van for the purpose of business, and with a neighbour who bought a van for her business, we both know - the tax man never checks to see how the vehicle is being used. They don't even come round and check if it is a van or not. They're not interested when you sell it, how much you sell it for, and don't ask for that sale money to be returned to the tax coffers. It's yours. The rich write off new phones, phone bills, computers, offices, clothes, hotel bills, business lunches, private jets, charity donations (that's a great scam that one. Donate $4,000,000 to charity, make your donation public to win public adoration, write it off against taxes, so the public end up effectively paying for that, since less money goes to the government and poorer people end up with less), they even claim against homes in other locations where their businesses are situated.  Accountancy assures that the richer you are the less percentage tax you end up paying. That's why there was such an uproar when the likes of Amazon, Google and eBay were finally forced to pay outstanding taxes to those countries bothered enough to keep pursuing them - and ended up paying paltry amounts of tax ( to ensure those countries never bother again). They 'know' how to work and how to hurt the system.  And how did it get like this? Because super rich companies and billionaires help certain individuals into politics, with promises of jobs as a board member after their political days. Politicians and board members are now stepping back and forth, interchanging between business and government, honing the rules and regulations surrounding taxation in the favour of businesses - and not ordinary people.  In the UK, you can earn up to around £14,000 (I think), before you pay any income tax. In the US, you pay income tax - whatever you earn. The lowest tax rate band in the US is 10% on 'all' money earned 'up to a certain limit' and not down to a certain limit. There is no minimum entitlement, like in the UK.   Maybe watch a few economics channels, made by actual economics experts with real life experience in government and big business. There are plenty of good ones on YouTube (George Gammon for example). I watched a lot during the pandemic, enough to make me feel well and truly sick at the situation. But as well as learning about how the likes of Bezos and Musk work the system so they pay laughably little tax when ratioed against that paid by an ordinary middle class earner, these economics advisors also tell us folks how we can better safeguard ourselves from the fast approaching global breakdown.  I used some of their advice and it has placed me in a better position, so it is not advice to be listened to briefly, and then dismissed with the next kitten and puppy video.

@@emilio1969 I don't know if you watched the video, but many of these homeless people went to Luxembourg to try to get a job and have a decent life. However, there are no job openings for them, and the rent is absurdly expensive. The situation is so bad in their country that it is better to be homeless in Luxembourg than to return there.  People use drugs when they want to forget about the problems in their lives, which is why they become addicted. The government should be the one taking care of people in need, not volunteers. Governments have the duty to take care of the ENTIRE population, that's why taxes exist. If the government is more concerned with taking care of the super rich than the rest of the population, then it is the population's duty to change it.  It's very stupid to blame the people who are suffering instead of those who are actually causing the problem.

I had a similar experience living in the Luxembourg city center. It was scary to enter the apartment block....  While supporting the poor, homeless and drug addicts you should not discriminate ordinary honest people who have a legal job, pay taxes and do not break the law. The video is manipulative and presents everyone in Luxembourg as a greedy milionnaire who has no empathy. I have not met any millionnaires since I moved to Lux, everyone I know is a normal middle class person living an average life like everywhere around Europe. The salaries are a bit higher than in neighboring countries and so are all the expenses we have to pay for - food, accomodation, childcare, etc.  People presented in the video already get all the benefits from our taxes, I do not feel obliged that I owe them something more. Especially if they came from another country hunting for social benefits. I also come from a poor country and I chose to work instead of begging for free benefits.

The wealth definitely trickled down, and L is probably the nation with the broadest middle class in the world.
Yeah GDP per capita has always been a flawed metric. Even without considering it’s a tax haven, the number is so high because the richest earners push the average higher. But the fact that GDP per capita is 119,000 euros does nothing to represent someone earning a fifth of that.

Neoliberalism and "housing as investment" policies formally  started with Margaret Thatcher: that's a historical fact, my generation lived through these things. We saw the dismantling of the concept of social good in real time, as the *greed is good* mantra took hold of Western culture - in a kind of death grip.  You sound like a very young person who doesn't know anyone older than yourself.
@duncansmith7562  I'll save time by recommending a book for you to read. It's called ' No such Thing as Society". It's a word picture of Britain under Thatcher in the Eighties. You may you learn some things from it that are new to you. Such as: the US adopted Thatcher's antisocial economic policies. Neoliberalism, in short: laissez faire "do as thou wilt". We all know how that turned out for ordinary working people.  Out of control banking and financial system, home foreclosures, frequent periods of mass unemployment, homelessness, the full catastrophe.

for Janick, those immigrant poor people are poor by choice in Luxembourg but he is poor in Luxembourg by no choice.  but it makes me think, if he's willing to accept any job then why not enlist in the army where he will most likely receive a free housing in the barracks and a stable income (and pension by the time he retires)?
Well, his ancestors were most likely there for thousands of years, using their blood sweat and tears to make the country, so I do think he should have more a claim than those who just move in. I'm sure his ancestors strove hard for their posterity, but people can't realize that.

​@@sanepillow59 That s quite strange  and ignorant to says its ok to immigrate from Germany or France to Luxembourg for Job but not from Africa.  First of all Luxembourgers do not share this thoughts they also feels that the French and German are the one taking their Jobs, same in Switzerland. Second Luxembourg even have issue hiring high skilled talents (I believe the same case for Germany)  and African immigrants go through much more struggle and selection the get here, they contribute to a very huge part of the GDP. not to mention Globalization which allow most European countries to have more markets and keep good economy level.  Third Switzerland and US are example of French German... immigration for Work and economic issues. So stop the hypocrisy.

@@syncrongames9644 more culturally connected to Germany than any other non German European -- depends. An Austrian or a Swiss would certainly feel more connected, simply from the fact that they'd never have had faced racial discrimination and will not be seen as foreigners even by the extreme right wing.

Some naïve comments talk about EU's free movement policy and agree with the nurse's opportunistic point of view on North African doctors working in Germany. Here is the thing: in Luxembourg, you'd rather be educated of a whatever nationality and LIVE IN LUXEMBOURG, not in the borders like this upstart nurse who prefers to get a Luxembourg salary and live with in Germany. Residents are much more respected than those crossborder workers who take advantage of the country and spend their money elsewhere. That's why they don't want any other people more educated than them to compete on the labor market. After all, who cares about some narrow-minded villageois who never left their towns except to work in Luxembourg. Luxembourg is much more tolerant and welcomes highly educated people from all over the world, not just those upstart people of the borders.
@@ShaftaloooooLet’s be intellectually honest here,was the nurse talking about languages or a specific segment of Africa? Must it be overt for you to understand it or do you seem to struggle with the clear undertone of her covert ethnocentrism. Whilst listening to her,I could somewhat understand her perspective,but I also busted out laughing……ooooh the paradox!
@@jazzochannel Now some of us who would love to have a thorough understanding,so to not appear uninformed and also not to manufacture some vacuous claims are asking,what exactly constitutes an “African accent “?

And from experience over the years encountering my fellow Africans,I acknowledge we are somewhat similar,but certainly different in terms of dialects and cultures. To put it succinctly,we are not monolithic,you sound ignorant!
@@drewbranch7700  You got a point, there is tendency among Europeans in general to convey meaning in diplomatic ways. But we as foreigners shouldn’t Americanise things. The Concept of race and skin tune in America has roots in injustice and slavery within America and the Hollywood was created to stigmatise against us. But the concept of race and skin tune is geographical in EU which carry less weight when it comes to racism in EU. As our part we have to blend with them as well. For example An English person going to Asia he would not demand for English food instead he would blend and eat Asian food. But my African friends here have to travel miles to get to the African grocery store to get African staff and don’t eat local food. Threw bad comments about English food. English people might laugh and joke in front of us but deep down they are not happy. We have to be mindful of our actions

@@syncrongames9644 yes that is what I am telling you and that is the truth, and it's because they have a fundamentally different cultures that prevents them from integrating you just have to compare immigrants after a few generations take a Polish, Italian, Ukrainian, Greek etc immigrants in Germany or France after 1-2 generations these immigrants assimilate and are indistinguishable from other French/Germans meanwhile Arab immigrants in France and Germany even after the 4th generation are completely unintegrated and foreign to the country of which they refuse to accept the rules and culture so yes another European is much closer to me then a Muslim ever will be even if he is born here

Liberal goverment privatized the dental service.  It was Orbán's goverment who make preventive dental care available. In case of emergency they got dental care for free, but they can not get prosthetic dentistry for free.
Most eu countries barely cover dental work and mental health is also disregarded
@@weird-guy in Hungary mental health is available for free but you can not force people to go to teraphy.  Some part of the plastic surgery also.
Yes no poor in India, the state provides. we could learn something in Europe

Absolutely yes
They are rich
Not unless they have a much more generous national law of the freedom of movement directive
I guess it’s called compassion.
Hungary is Central Europe. Eastern Europe is a political statement made after the second world war.
By the documentary it seems that politicians do not even help your people, the rich get richer and the poor poorer by design, good to know that Luxembourg is another fascade claiming that they are rich when in reality only a small percentage is.
@@mikilos100 but hungarys majority mindset is still very much eastern. you need to differentiate geological location from that of society.
IS YOUR CAPS LOCK KEY GLUED DOWN AGAIN OR ARE YOU JUST SCREAMING?????????
To think .5 % of the population owns so much by inheritance . The elephant in the room.
As long they don't come to Switzerland...
Portugal is not Eastern Europe 😅
​@@adammorra3813 So, in your mind Luxemburg should take care of people that hasn't worked for the money just because you think that they are "rich"? Do you realize that they won't be rich for long when hundreds of thousands of people from the middle east decides to move in?
@NickanM  they have the money and middle easterns cant just move there they need a visa. And if you move there you are working and paying taxes. So its all Gucci
​​@@malysevthanks god for that. I hope we will never ever have western mindset. Me as a Hungarian living in Western Europe at the moment can tell you that for me that mentality as alien as vica versa. But thats why we like Europe. Its colorful.
@@mikilos100 lol, so you dont like western mindset, but you moved to western europe :D interesting paradox :D maybe you should try russia instead :D
​@@malysevTrue. Anything beyond the Iron curtain is Eastern Europe.   Poles, Hungarians, Slovaks, Ukrainians, and even East Germans demonstrate very similar kind of mentality.
@@malysev did I say that I dont like it? I said its different for sure and I am quite happy to have a different mindset.
@@asmirann3636 well, personally I dont like to generalize like this. some of these are more western, some eastern, some change over time based on current economic-political spectrum etc. Slovakia and Hungary certainly turned their ship back east unfortunately and I doubt they will gain anything good from it. Czechia and Poland is next, lets see how they will decide in their upcoming elections.
@@mikilos100 fair enough. it sounded like you dont like it.
Don’t worry, a lot of people don’t even know Luxembourg exists…but wow, you shout loud enough ‘they’ may hear you and come take away your bonus😂

@@EarlGreyLattex That Yannick dude should go back to school and educate himself instead of blaming the poor around him and yet eats with them and have the audacity to complain to the Grand Duchy about something he has no clue about.
@@lucaspierre9305 Well said. Those ideals are always inline with the uneducated or unambitious.
Letting foreigners in has nothing to do with capitalism or anything
@@mrmap4875 Ask yourself why the world’s leading companies hire people from all over the world to work together. Why is ASML or LHC a project of different kinds of people?   I will tell you very clearly as someone who is from America. Europe will never be on the world stage again because of their views on immigration. We already have a massive issue in America trying to curb this in the fools trying to hold back progress. To ask Europe to do it is asking gravity to go away for a day.
@@mrmap4875 Then why doesn’t Europe have as many highly technological companies on the world stage as America?
@@3dandelion bcoz of america capitalist europe isn't
@@mrmap4875 no because America makes people from all over the world work together. They learned a long time ago that intelligence isn’t a matter of ethnicity or genetics. Only the people holding society back feel that way.  Europe cannot compete with America because of this fact.
@@mrmap4875 Absolutely not. The world’s richest companies in America make people who are different work together. That’s why.
@@3dandelion do you even know the visa policies of america they literally take the top layer from other countries in my country india those clear the most difficult exam goes to IIT nd secure the job in silicon valley there's no way commoners like me go to america that's why indian go to canada but i don't cuz i have some pride left in me
@@mrmap4875 Well, I’m from America. So I understand the “highly skilled” workers visas. The H-1B visas.   Indians are often recruited because of their abilities, but they are not the only ones. In fact, many of these companies hire a significant portion of people from America, Europe and Asia. Even some African countries despite their societal progress being behind. Pride in country is admirable, but pride in advancement transcends that.   Ask yourself why they leave in the first place? Why does anyone leave? To seek progress. Whether in their own lives or at institutions that foster it. What will people do when AGI and Quantum is achieved & applied to robotics?   They will be forced to learn & adapt. It’s very easy to hide behind ethnicity or nationality but those things fall short in the face of progress.
@@lucaspierre9305 I doubt he has that level of self awareness
Early and mid stage capitalism were even worse

The original inhabitants are ethnic Germans (Volksdeutsche) 0
Yeah,if they help some,it will persuade more non citizens migrate there😅
Surely, that is an issue of being part of Schengen. European non-citizens have the right to be there.
It’s our civic duty. This is what taxes include. To care for the vulnerable.  People, (including you) can loose everything in an instant and caring for those individuals will perhaps stop them from sleeping on the streets and or carrying out some desperate measures that could impact on your life….hope this is not an adult asking this question
​@@dredknots invite one of them to sleep at your place then. There many neighborhoods in my country that i cant afford...so I look in a neighborhood that is in my budget.
a huge part of the people who work and pay taxes in Luxembourg come from the neighbouring countries and are not citizens either
@@PLuMUK54 No they have not, If European you have 3 month to find work, a place to live ect ect. You can´t stay for ever just living by beeging and collect bottels. If you get chaught you be send home by Bus.
@@geoffoakland your suggestion is absurd.
@@geoffoaklandwhat exactly do you mean by ‘one of them’? If it’s a homeless person, my mother and I were homeless when I was a child. She, a British citizen always worked ..at a point she fell on hard times whilst she was working and could not afford a place of her own. She  couldn’t just magically up and leave her job or disrupt my schooling and just move like that…we lived in a homeless shelter for 2 years until she was fortunate to be awarded a council property. 40 years later I happily pay my taxes for others to reap that benefit. Furthermore I have actually given acquaintances and a colleague or 2 my spare room or couch over  the years until they found their feet or they may have ended up god knows where…. So yes..i have…..don’t know why you’d assume everyone is virtue signaling.
​@@dredknots❤❤❤❤
@@dredknotsnope. This first man from Hungary does not look vulnerable . He looks lazy .
​@@PLuMUK54No they don't.
​@@dredknotsTaxes paid by a country's citizens are to be paid to provide services for THAT country and its citizens.  Were the migrants legal or illegal?
​@@PLuMUK54What if the situation was reversed? Would a European expect to live off the taxpayers?
@@junglesuperstar9270I don’t judge by looks. You’re entitled to though
@@williamegler8771I’m talking about homeless and vulnerable..you’re talking about migrants…fill your boots with your opinions 😘
@@dredknots it u it s not looks . It is his attitude and life style
​@@dredknotsIt is true that I could lose everything but I expect the country that I  am a citizen of and paid taxes in to provide for me before a non-citizen.
​@dredknots You do the same with your opinions.  If you're so concerned why don't you open your home and allow the homeless and the indigent to live with you?
@@williamegler8771 sounds like that’s what happens by this report
@@williamegler8771 do you know me by the way? Like how you jump to conclusions 😂
@@junglesuperstar9270ok you can have a problem with him if you like…(and you are).  but my biggest concern are the well dressed rich people that steal from the poor…and to me, they are a larger problem
@@junglesuperstar9270you can also judge him by his attitude, he’s still not living in a mansion is he? Like those who do live in mansions and steal from the poor via their accountants…and that’s becoming more and more evident everyday, everywhere in the world. So you focus on those with an attitude, who have nothing , as though  they’re  about to clean out your pension…or make you redundant .
Better money distribution. Tax the rich and use those taxes to create a social reintegration for the young with work requalification (work that is in high demand, like programming). They are not citizens but they r residents. Ignoring the problem won't make it disappear. It actually make it even worst, with robbery and violence. The bigger the financial difference between ppl, the more price rises the world will see ...
Also there are Luxembourg citizens in dangerous financial sit, not only immigrants. Idk if they r legal but by the looks of their public health cards, the government is aware of the situation.
@@dredknots he has zero reason not to work . Period .
Then why they let these people in that's the price you pay for not taking an action
🤷‍♂ 🤷‍♂ 🤷‍♂
Easy. Rich have resources. Poor have poverty. That's just how it be.

More money to the migrants
​@@danielgospodinov5786 Europe has always been a poverty stricken continent until the discovery of new lands.   It's not the immigrants. It's just that capitalism has stopped working for Europe, especially when bigger players such as China have entered the world market.
@@asmirann3636 No wrong, It was industry that saved us, more production with fewer people (and the crazy religious did we send to America)
@@mabuhayproductionltd3627  Wrong. It was the colonial loot that build Europe.   And the crazy religious Americans are far more liberal and progressive than Europeans. US also is a bigger economy.  The liberal democratic order that you also reap benefits off is an American order.

@@asmirann3636   Capitalism stopped working only because socialism co-opted it.
Socialism is for resentful losers who are just as greedy but who instead of providing some value to society, choose to use the full force of the state to forcibly strip others of their wealth. Gross.
Rich gotta rich. Poor gotta suffer, serve, and submit. It is what it is.
Haven't we already seen enough revolutions which amounted to nothing ? What was the aftermath of French Revolution ? Moderates killed too, Hungry people ? How dare they speak of hunger and tarnish the revolution Guillotine for you too !  In Market Economies one of the literal first few things we talk about in Market Cap which is the max potential of certain Company/Idea. Stop with this infinite growth nonsense . Relevant and capable companies overrun less deserving companies. It takes only a few stupid decision to end a company.  We have seen One Man Genius Economists in Soviet Union ,GDR,Romania, Maoist China,etc which killed more people of hunger that you can fathom.  Funny how Commies have had to build walls to stop people from leaving while Capitalists have to build wall to stop people from coming in.
Now if you wan't to know real Reason for rising poverty , Population has grown 8 folds in last ~100 years  Cities have no grown by 8 folds in size in last 100 years There has been mass urbanization , Farming used to be the major sector while now it employees less than 2% of population  The rate at which cities are building houses does not match with the rate at which people are demanding them. You wan't rent lowered ? Expect even more people moving in .  Realistic solutions to this problem should have been new cities popping up  Like France needs like 2 more Paris, Germany needs a few more Munich's , etc
Spoken like a true commie…
@@dennislosee   Communism you say?   Well consider your own anatomy first.   Superdeterministic Consciousness:  The unconscious mind "sells" the conscious mind on the concept of Reality. The conscious mind "buys" Reality from the unconscious mind.  Forming an illusory feedback system (creating the illusion of choice).  The subconscious mind being a broker between both; neurological imbalances occurring when the conscious mind resists unconscious narratives (superdeterministic).  Sentience (environmental feedback) propagates consciousness through emergent (microorganisms forming macroscopic life) sensory experiences (environmental exposure), leading to the formation of memories, thus establishing corollary emotional states (dependent on experiences experienced). These emotional markers are activated during recall (remembering).  (Intelligence levels also being predetermined)  Microorganisms are sentient but don't experience conscious intelligence until emergence is factored; swarming as a collective through emergence - forming greater scales of intelligence (hive-mind/macroscopic life).  Everything naturally occurring is Nature, which includes plants, microorganisms, humans (all lifeforms), atoms, energy, stars, planets, black holes, cancer, AIDS, space, Dreams, and Consciousness. (Say what!?)  Nature is Emergence.   Roughly half of the total cells (~15 trillion!) comprising an average human are other individually sentient organisms (microbiota).   Any individual that believes they aren't being wholly influenced by half of their overall cellular matrix; I would encourage them to test that theory, by subtracting half of themselves from existence.
